  Very slim ,light weight easily carry in traveling.Good battery time.....Min 5hrsFor office use best one.

"

  I bought this exchanging my Acer Aspire V5 intel i3 laptop since Pentium Gold processor is almost same, except for lesser L3 cache memory (3 MB to 2 MB).There is absolutely no heating or any other issues due to SSD. This fits my requirement of day to day browsing, reading, videos etc.  Very good laptop for this price.Good price for old laptop & card discount from ICICI due to Diwali sale.

  initial impression is excellent...light weight,thin,travel friendly.Super fast booting,due to ssd. hop this laptop last long.lets see what happen due to corse of time.

  I am a Computer Technician, and i have purchased and configured 5 of these. 2 were purchased from Amazon.Key Points.1) Initial Setup takes around 40 minutes but after that2) LAPTOP BOOTS IN LESS THAN 10 SECONDS (5 seconds frankly)Yes this laptop is Super FAST, because of its m.2 ssd.3) Clients with 3rd and 4th generation Core i5 laptops with 8 GB Rams couldnt spot the Difference in speeds. You are basically comparing a 45000rs - 65000rs year 2015 Laptops with a 2020, 30000rs. Which is just 2 core 2mb cache. Still is fast.. Thank you m.24) Recomended for people who want a Blazing fast laptop for Surfing, working on Excel, word.This laptop has1) License Lifetime Original Windows2) License for 1 year Microsoft Office student edition (word excel one note)3) has a 250 GB m.2 SSD Storage. (BLAZING FAST)4) Single Slot 4 GB Ram (If you want to upgrade to 16 GB.. its going to be a Difficult Turn)Word of Advice.1) IF you work simultaeously on Multiple Softwares. like 6 -  10 Excel sheets or heavy programmes like Adobe, then you may consider skipping this laptop as the RAM is just 4 gb2) Only Intel graphics but Old adobe and basic 3d softwares below 2018 works.Its a Value for Money. I am waiting for Competition like DELL and LENOVO to launch their varients so prices will drop. in 2 years.

  I am writing this review after using the laptop for one month.1) The MS office 2019 is original , just activate when you recieve it by login into your microsoft account. If you don't have a microsoft account create it.2) The laptop boots in just 3 to 4 second. It is very fast on SSD.3) The shutdown also takes just 3 second, thus you save your valuable time.4) The processing is also very reasonable and good at this price.5) It work for about 7 hour in one charge.6) Autocad 2017 is working fine on it.7) Overall the performance of the laptop is very good.One can buy it without any doubts.

  Worst service from Amazon and the seller. After buying this laptop I found that it's not suitable for running Android studio and I wanted to return it to get a higher configuration laptop but to my surprise I can't return it, the very next day. I was in the impression that we can return any item on Amazon but that was my biggest mistake and I lost 25k. This laptop is useless for me. Not happy at all.

  It's Amazing! I have never ever thought the SSD can be so fast that the Windows will boot In just 5 seconds!I Really Loved the HP Laptop with Windows 10 Home + Office 2019 Students already included lifetime.The only reason for choosing this Laptop over the One with Ryzen A9 APU available on other ecommerce site, & choosing the Pentium 4417U is that, it's faster than the Ryzen.I really love this lightweight laptop & it's compactness makes it worth.This laptop is really great if you want windows office and a powerful processor with SSD in this segment of upto ₹28,000 /-

  Purchased this laptop on 29th October 2019.Writing a review after almost 1 year of usage. To start with this laptop is very quick to start when powered on, hardly takes 5 seconds to start up.Great for those with basic requirements like daily surfing, Watching movies, MS office, Excel, Powerpoint and basic editing tasks. Due to SSD it works like charm.Pros- SSD makes it pretty fast with 5-7 seconds boot and start time. (I checked higher end models in shops but could not find one that starts as quickly this)- Light weight, this is pretty light and easy to carry, my earlier samsung laptop used to weigh almost 2 kgs and this slim trim piece comes as a delight to me in terms of weight.- Great battery life, haven't found any problems with battery life till now. It works 6-8 hours on a single charge easily. For me it is on almost for the entire day and it still works great.- Great volume, I am yet to see a laptop with so crystal clear sound. Most laptops have very low volume.- Got windows 10 and MS office students version license with it which is great add-on at this price point. (many higher priced laptops also don't provide this).Cons- Well almost none for me considering my requirements but you can find difficulties with viewing angles and screen resolution while watching movies, but I have no complains for it at this price point.ConclusionA great value for money laptop at this price point, After one year I can say that I am pretty happy with the purchase.

  One of the worst company and laptop available on Amazon...laptop is not working after 6 month use..and worst part is hp customer support they will first waste ur 4-5 days by just doing similar troubleshooting then send some moron technician again this cycle will go on but the problem of laptop will never be resolved...so never buy this laptop

"
"

  Microsoft not working properly. Is it a defective piece

"
"

  Delivered one day earlier. Windows 10 and MS office Home & Student activated easily.USB ports are very tightly fitting. Speakers quality just good. Battery approx 5 hours.Reviewed after one day of use.

"
"

  Price wise it is a good buy. Major drawback is outer body build quality as the body is not metallic and feels more like card board type. Also battery cannot be removed from outside. It is made in China.

"
"

  Don't buy this product.. Return policy is not available.

"
"

  Writing this review after 6 months use. Got it for my daughters online classes. No problem till now. Start and shut down in 2 sec.. pretty fast.Pls go for it if you want basic laptop for regular use and browsing.Preinstalled Microsoft Office is a plus.Only con is Camera is very bad but its ok for me coz i don't use it.

"
"

  The processor is so fast , it's really good for office work and watching movies go for it...

"
"

  Its slow as hell and also only after using for 10 days the alphabet markings are rubbing off and disappearing from the keys on keyboard. A very sub standard product.

   This is a very bad laptop. Do not take it. It hangs and stops running. I have been compelled on amazon many times but they have taken it so far

"
"

  Really a wonderful product, backup is great, charging very fast, windows 10 is licencrd and free forever, MS Office is not free. It boots very fast, we can attent phone calls, sms of phone, photos on phone very easily, need not go and take your phone to attend or make calls or sms. It is not for gaming or movies, though good enough for YouTube etc.

"

  Cant believe it's a HP Laptop. I don't think people should consider buying Laptop from Amazon.Amazon team don't take any accountability post the Product is sold. They sell through Partners and possibly fake products. The HP laptop INR >25K didnot last even for 3 months.Few pointers,- The Laptop didnot have a Serial Number (there is NO sticker label pasted on the body of the Laptop).- Thereafter I called up Amazon and raised this issue ... at first they did not acknowledge the problem. Finally, they accepted. However, NO resolution was provided.- Performance of the Laptop - the less you talk about it , the better it's. Its pathetically slow and HDD has already crashed. In terms of Config, it's 4GB/1TB HDD however the performance is worse than my 4 early old Laptop.It was a terrible experience for me. People should reconsider before buying from Amazon.

"
"

  Just few days but in love with the product ... its light and i like the large fonts on the keypad ... pre installed windows 10 and its easy to set up .. I m Loving IT ;)

"
"

  If you are looking for a laptop for work from home or office use you should go for it without a second thought. Because of its great battery backup and speed due to SSD. Also it's lightweight and good looking too.But if you are looking for a laptop which should be both good for Work and Gaming you should consider buying another one, because of its low processor and graphics card. It's not good for gaming. You will get good average gaming laptops with more specifications under 40 - 50K if you are lucky.

"
"

  Its a good student laptop and you can go for it.Not for gaming or running too much of multi-tasking. Support mentions it can be upgraded to 8GB RAM , still need to check it out. RAM slot support mentions is 1 but shows 2 on the system properties.Overall a good laptop for this price and its light weight too.

"
"

  Excellent laptop. Beats macbook air in every department other than battery life, which is about 7 hours. Reviewed after six months usage

"
"

  This  is very very low class product. not working perfectly. hanging in the middle of the programme.  customer care is not responding. i made big mistake for buying this product.

"
"

  It is very fast and light weight laptop. I recommend this, because of value of money. It is really faster than i3 laptops. Good to go...

"
"

  The Laptop is quite light and very fast, especially when starting the OS. The only con is the storage space when compared to the traditional drives, which again is a part of the specification. Overall a good buy!

"
"

  Small product and on the laptop body there designing gripAnd it's SSD drive is awesome it takes max 3-4 second for startup and max 2 second for shutdownThis is happening coz of ssd drive I suggest u to if u have basic use then go for it

"
"

  this product didnot work properly according to my desires

"
"

  Don't get carried away by price . Not suitable for graphic designers, anyone into photoshop of visual mediums through computer..graphics are terrible, colors are muddled and dark.I should have.done better research.What I do like about it is it's very light weight and airy !

"
"

  Pros:-  It is really very light weight  Its very fast alsoIf you don't require much space go with this  it prodiess awesome speed ,Boot ups in 5 sec ,Cons:-  You have to  compromise with storageBut a external hard drive would work goodNo fingerprint of face id ,Lower processor, But overall value for money, and its quality is also good ,(Review after one day of usage)

"
"

  Value for the money...Best budget lap ever...

"
"

  Item as described, super fast delivery. Will review the laptop after a few weeks of use.

"
"

  The product is slow like a turtle. Shame on the professor. Only good for browsing, that too takes long because of entered words to appear, or to open chrome🙆‍♂️ I can't believe I just lost 25K for this

"
"

  I brought it in exchange of my old one for my daughter s school. All was pre installed.Speed is very good. After pressing the switch it's make it ready in know time. Almost 20 days over no operational issus detected.

"
"

  The speed is very slow even to just see the photos and videos.. sole purpose I’ve purchased this laptop is to watch movies and surf stuffs, see photos  tu is but it’s even slower for this basic operations .. display screen is extremely shady and glare .. if you’re watching movie just aside then you won’t be able to see the picture

   I dont know what to say. Usually window 10 sucks. It takes more than 2 min to reboot.I had to click more than 5 time to start a chrome.I am taking to a hp storeroom to install window 7 and remove this window 10.

"
"

  This laptop has stopped working just after using it for two weeks. I do not know if this is a fake product.

"
"

  discovered a defected software within the first 5hrs of use which the hp guys can't even fix and they won't let you return. Don't buy this product unless you want to donate your cash. The hp team will be brutal when you contact them. Wish i could give them a 0 star rating.

"
"

  Plastic is not that much great. Performance is good and battery backup is good

"
"

  Not as light but good

"
"

  Poor build quality, processor speed is too slow, device hangs quite often, no inbuilt wireless router, slow charging & battery backup is also not up to the mark. It seems that the battery is refurbished..Hope Amazon will replace the item sooner...

"
"

  Highly recommend this laptop.If you required laptop for normal use..I will strongly recommend this laptop.i have got my laptop today and satisfied with the quality and all functions.

"
"

  Very slow processor I couldn't run programs in this laptop.it will take long time to open browser.and all other then this it's fine

"
"

  Poor performance.. Do not buy this item.. Gets hang every time... just bought the new laptop and even online classes are no possible on the laptop.

"
"

  Got it in 26000.It's a nice product with pre loaded MS office and windows.

"
"

  Even a single tab is not opening at normal speed. It is very dead slow. The laptop response is very slow even if i open the file manager.  Amazon is not accepting the complaint, and redirecting to the seller page.

   Very slow processor, within few weeks line appeared on the screen, tragic purchase, and now from the date of the first review another line is appearing in the screen

"
"

  Laptop is very slow, have never seen such a slow motion laptop ever, just to save some money don't get in to trap.

"
"

  I am using it from last one month.....its value for money.....battery power is reasonable, light weight, very low start time.

"
"

  What a pathetic customer service. 5G is not enabled on the laptop and then when contacted customer support they are just useless, no resolution provided.Didn't expect such service.

"
"

  Absolutely values for money , no issues with OS and window 10 and antivirusAll perfect just that the option to upgrade SSD should have been available

"
"

  Lightning fast boot upBetter use external KB and mouse

  1. Display -102. Sound - 93. Trackpad - 84. Battery backup - 9 (initial impressions regarding battery is good)5. Looks - 106. Webcam - 7 ( awkward position )7. Build - 8 ( I don't feel it is that bad good quality plastic is used ( at least it feels so) need to check in the long run.8. Multitasking - 7 ( considering the price bracket it comes in it is justifiable.9. Heating issue - not faced till now but without fan it would be difficult to control the temperature.10. Value for money - 9Overall considering the price  of rs15000 and for my case it was rs 7200 (exchanged 10 yr old i3 processor laptop) this laptop does the light job like surfing net and making some ppts and watching video as the laptop has great screen - full hd with anti glare display is something that is unavailable in this price bracket before.Who should consider this laptop ?Anyone who has very light usage microsoft word, office , excel or those who wants a laptop for entertainment purpose, or for online classes, online test series, for attending meetings etcAnyone who wants to run any moderate to heavy apps should stay away from buying it.

  Recieved today.1. First impression is good.Does the job for the Price. Don't expect much from this by spending 13.5 k money.Expecting gaming and editing etc. from this low priced entry level machine is a foolish thing. Expect, upto what u spent on the product.(only disappointing factor who actually disappointed by their purchase)2. MS office is trail version only lasts for one week after setting it up.3. But, I don't know the reliability of this machine.4.I think it can be used for adequate period of time, if we handle it smoothly and carefully.5. Best under budget laptop with good built quality, sound and display6. A good replacement for tablet. Used for online classes for kids and documentation works and entertainment purposes....

  This laptop is designed for following basic task-1-Office work(MS word, excel, PowerPoint etc)2- Basic net surfing (Fb, Youtube, Online form filling etc)3-Watching movie4- Good batteryBelieve me this laptop handles all above mentioned tasks like a boss in a speedy way. All of this due to 128GB m.2 ssd installed in it.Pros-1- IPS Display 9/102- SSD 9/103- 4-5hr battery backup 7/104- Design 8/105- Build quality 7/10Cons-1- 3.5hr of Charging time2- Charger Quality3- Sometimes mouse trackpad & keys are a bit unresponsive.Verdict- This laptop @13.5-15k price is 100% value for money.Although this laptop equipped with celeron processor but believe me it does what it is meant for. You can't expect a scooter to carry the loads of a Truck. Same goes here. This laptop is made for basic tasks and it does flawlessly. Hence it is a perfect budget choice for students, online classes, office works etc.If you are in Gaming & video editing work..then please don't buy this laptop. This laptop is not made for such tasks.Thanks.

  So, I ordered this after reading the reviews of my predecessors. I can say I was not at all disappointed. I got this machine today and I am writing the review from this. Well, as I started to setup this up, I realized that it was too slow. I gave it the benefit of doubt and shut it down for later use. when I setup it up, the battery was around 70%. At the end of the setup it as 60. Fine, I give it an hour and resume exploring it. I set the mode to battery saver and cleansed all the unnecessary apps, and downloaded chrome and acrobat. I want to use this laptop for light browsing, creating word documents, reading pdfs and watching movies in spare time. Thus far, it has now disappointed. The display is amazing  and one can feel the SSD in action- crisp and sharp. I have used macbook air and this doesnt disappoint. Also, the design is very catchy, inspired from Macbook and Yoga 360. The price was also decent. Well, I started a 60% battery, remember- it is 34 now. The battery sis the only concern I see. but otherwise this is awesome. Zyada ungli mat karo- chup chap laptop kholo, normal use karo rakhdo. Zyada kalakari karne ki avashyakta nahi hai. If you expect that you can hack Iran's nuclear plant with this , then All the Best. Do not use it for heavy coding and games. Also the frame is decent ,not aluminum but plastic but I find it sturdy and ultra light. I will update this as I move with this machine.

  1. Display -102. Sound - 93. Trackpad - 84. Battery backup - 9 (initial impressions regarding battery is good)5. Looks - 106. Webcam - 7 ( awkward position )7. Build - 8 ( I don't feel it is that bad good quality plastic is used ( at least it feels so) need to check in the long run.8. Multitasking - 7 ( considering the price bracket it comes in it is justifiable.9. Heating issue - not faced till now but without fan it would be difficult to control the temperature.10. Value for money - 9Overall considering the price  of rs15000 and for my case it was rs 7200 (exchanged 10 yr old i3 processor laptop) this laptop does the light job like surfing net and making some ppts and watching video as the laptop has great screen - full hd with anti glare display is something that is unavailable in this price bracket before.Who should consider this laptop ?Anyone who has very light usage microsoft word, office , excel or those who wants a laptop for entertainment purpose, or for online classes, online test series, for attending meetings etcAnyone who wants to run any moderate to heavy apps should stay away from buying it.

  Recieved today.1. First impression is good.Does the job for the Price. Don't expect much from this by spending 13.5 k money.Expecting gaming and editing etc. from this low priced entry level machine is a foolish thing. Expect, upto what u spent on the product.(only disappointing factor who actually disappointed by their purchase)2. MS office is trail version only lasts for one week after setting it up.3. But, I don't know the reliability of this machine.4.I think it can be used for adequate period of time, if we handle it smoothly and carefully.5. Best under budget laptop with good built quality, sound and display6. A good replacement for tablet. Used for online classes for kids and documentation works and entertainment purposes....

  This laptop is designed for following basic task-1-Office work(MS word, excel, PowerPoint etc)2- Basic net surfing (Fb, Youtube, Online form filling etc)3-Watching movie4- Good batteryBelieve me this laptop handles all above mentioned tasks like a boss in a speedy way. All of this due to 128GB m.2 ssd installed in it.Pros-1- IPS Display 9/102- SSD 9/103- 4-5hr battery backup 7/104- Design 8/105- Build quality 7/10Cons-1- 3.5hr of Charging time2- Charger Quality3- Sometimes mouse trackpad & keys are a bit unresponsive.Verdict- This laptop @13.5-15k price is 100% value for money.Although this laptop equipped with celeron processor but believe me it does what it is meant for. You can't expect a scooter to carry the loads of a Truck. Same goes here. This laptop is made for basic tasks and it does flawlessly. Hence it is a perfect budget choice for students, online classes, office works etc.If you are in Gaming & video editing work..then please don't buy this laptop. This laptop is not made for such tasks.Thanks.

  Review after using for 4 days.Pro's -1) Performance - It can easily handle basic tasks such as browsing, MS office, watching movies & online class.2) Storge - Even though we juz get 128gb ssd storage(out of which 94gb is available to use), we can expand Storage using memory card slot. One thing i liked in this laptop is we can easily insert memory card without card reader juz like we do in mobile phone. I brought 128gb sd card & inserted in it. I am storing all my files in the sd card. Don't store any files in system storge (128gb ssd slot). It will slowdown the Performance of system.3) Display & Sound - Top class 👍4) 🔋- OkayishCons -1) Charger pin is very loose. I m worried about its durability2) Hinge - I am really worried about hinge. It's very loose. Hope it won't fall down. Avita should focus on this4) Keyboard & mouse pad are hard.3) Build quality - Actually i don't say this as con for the price i paid(13600rs). I am satisfied with plastic built quality for this price. We need to be careful & make sure that laptop won't fall down from height.Finally if you are looking for basic laptop for online classes, Watching movies, MS office, browsing & if you can handle laptop carefully. Then go for it.

  Game changer is 128GB SSD, boots windows in 15-20 seconds.Browsing websites, watching videos, working on online worksheets is faster.Even 10 different browsing windows works fine. More than that slows down the Laptop.Not much heating initially but after 2-3 hours of continuous usage bottom gets heated.Very thin and lightweight and medium sturdy, so not for heavy rough and tough usage.Keyboard is good. Touchpad position is awkward and size big, so people with bigger palms will accidently touch mouse touchpad when typing.Overall after a month of usage, found not much issues for general usage of browsing/meetings/videos watching. Not tried any games and any external apps as Windows is in S mode. But with browser all apps usable, like spreadsheet, document editing, youtube, etc.

"

  Build is OK for better other other avita model I m not expecting this goodEverything 5in display very goodKeyboard connectivity battery back up also goodBut I return this laptop due to speakers not working and also no fan in this model temperature always 60 to 75 degreeNot good for game not even high quality video playback. Only good office 360 and browse low quality video playback Utube netflix etc

"
"

  Heating issue. Memory issue. Received uses old stock item with lot of dust and scratch. I lost my money in buying this waste product

"
"

  Very good laptop for 15000 I bought it for 5700 under exchange.For browsing and simple official work only and email check best laptop the screen resolution 1240x1920 good one for you tube and movies

"
"

  Only for very basic purpose of 90's. Dont expect much from laptop but laptop expects user to have lots of patience even for basic operation.

"
"

  i just gotta fan of the display. Display is just awesome. Looking is too good , light wieght.Not for high processes. Very good for productive use. Like browsing , entertainment and basic applications will run smooth. SSD inbuilt, too responsible. More than i expected.Only thing is speakers are too bad, and little build quality is compromised. Rest, Worth more than money.

   Recent review- (earlier review can be found after recent)Since past couple or weeks I had observed mouse touch-pad issue. The movement of mouse is not as expected, it’s slow. I made all possible changes in settings but no use.It’s a bugger when I use MSPaint tool. While working in mspaint the mouse pointer suddenly jumps anywhere on the screen.(Attached video)I had registered complaint to Avita customer care about this and they attended in 2 days and the technician replaced entire touch pad along with keyboard. But still the problem was not resolved.I have again registered the complaint and will see what they do about it.Will keep you updated.....——————————-Below was the review I posted in first 4 days-——————————-A suggestion to laptop buyers is that before purchasing it, know what your own requirement is.I purchased this laptop for my son’s school activities like Online classes, video conferencing etc.Basic activities like MS Teams, MS Office, Browsing etc. can be done without any problems.As it comes with Windows 10 in S Mode, you have an option to disable it but I preferred not to, because its Secured mode and it helps to keep laptop safe from any Malware and saving you additional Antivirus cost.This laptop gives me battery backup of AT LEAST 4hrs with uninterrupted online class.Standby time would be definitely beyond that.Build quality is good according to its price. It costed me around 17k. I searched Amazon, Flipkart for budget laptops and this was the only one that deemed fit in my requirements.SSD really makes difference than conventional HDD. Its super fast, loads windows in seconds(depending on config).All ports are working fine. Please Note- This laptop DOES NOT have a Lan Port as it supports Bluetooth and Wifi only. As most of us are working on Wifi only, Lan port should not be an issue.Overall- I am satisfied with the laptop. I may change my review after couple of month’s usage if I see any difference in performance.

  I was very apprehensive of buying this computer but I did not have the budget to go for i3 or i5 so I bought this. Oh man ! this is one heck of a laptop. You will be delighted to lay your hands on this laptop. The screen is top quality, similar in quality to that found on many top-end models.  It is not shiney but matte which you can use for long periods of time without problem. The keyboard is decent and comfortable. The touchpad may have been better, it does not have the finesse of higher end models. The body is made of plastic but looks stunningly good. Hope it does not start showing signs of wear for some time.  The size of the laptop is just perfect, light-weight and very comfortable to work on. Speakers are ok, acceptable at this price point, sound is loud enough. It has a front camera which is Ok in quality but it is placed in a very odd position (near the screen and keyboard joint) which makes it not suitable for most face to face chats.The speed of the laptop is very good. It boots in 10 s and shuts down in the same time. All applications such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Office run smoothly. It does not show any lag even when I open a lot of programs together. Battery life is decent, about 3-4 hours on a single charge.All ports are located on the back side, not on the sides as in other laptops but this is not much of inconvenience and I am hardly inconvenienced because of this.The nest this about this laptop is the top quality screen. The worst thing is the placement of camera and probably a little less than perfect track pad (but not too bad).

  Since I have ps4 console, I bought this laptop only for office work, browsing and watching online stream videos.. If u need for basic use, go for it. This is not a gaming laptop.. I had Asus laptop previously and it sucks in performance and cost around 25k however i bought this laptop as exchange for 9k and the speed is awesome. Battery backup comes around 3hrs 30min if we watch videos. Normal use comes around 5hrs. Its very slim one weighing around 1.3kg only. Easy to carry not like my old asus(heavy one) and my office dell laptop(weighing around 2kg) Overall a good budget laptop Worth 9k for basic level. I will again update you guys after three month use.

"

  Below are my verdicts compared to the price I bought it (₹17,150)# Well built, nice looking, slim and light weight# Windows 10 built in, though in S mode, but S mode can be disabled with latest Windows updates# Decent performance for few light weight multi tasking, such as web surfing, playing songs via media player, documents editing, connecting to remote desktops. Dont expect any gaming performance from this humble device.# Keypad is nice, no backlit though# 2 USB ports, 1 HDMI# Screen display is really nice, nice resolution# Battery back up is fine. Depending on usage. I am getting in between 5 hours to 7 hours for very light weight use with battery saving mode enabled.# Camera quality is not upto the mark, could have been better# Mouse trackpad is nice, wide, intuitive# 4 Gig RAM serves the purpose# 120 GB SSD delivers good performance# Bottleneck is created by 2 vCPU Intel Celeron processors. But overall manages to deliver basic performance, CPU clocks upto 2.5 GHz when demand is High. L1 and L2 cache are on lower side, no L3 cache.# Speaker is loud enough, lacks the fineness / Quality, but does the job, you can watch YouTube, Movies, listen to songs..Overall, a nice well built laptop at this price with decent performance for basic activities, don't load it up with too many apps running in parallel, it will serve you well.Also, wait for offer price. It is a value for money product when bought at price around 17K, Not at its normal price which 19K

  I didn't expect such a fabulous product for such a low price. Its a fully functional laptop with all basic features, looks elegant & Cute. faster booting time, nice keys, super display. Speakers are bit inferior, but still good for the value. The batter charge stands well and charging is fairly quick. This is the first day impression. Well and safely packed. Didi the online registration for the warranty using the serial no on the back of the laptop.

"
"

  Decent as it is mentioned, not meant for gaming at all, suitable for office work and media consumption.. Had to use external mouse since mouse touch pad is very irritating.. In conclusion it's an extremely basic laptop.

"

  Battery backup is really osm and display is fabulous...iam facing heating issue during YouTube at 4kAnd build quality is not superb ,only okay productThe main quality of the laptop is storageVery suitable for lite document works and watching photos and mvies

  Bingo!!!! The product is simply awesome and Kudos to Amazon and Seller for brining pocket friendly product at this tight budget situations.

"
"

  Bad choice, screen is not effective, hangs , machinery and system over all is ineffective, keys don't press properlyI am bound to keep this since Amazon refused to take return or do replacement, all that money on this laptop is a waste now as this laptop is a show pieceNot at all recommendedThis feedback is a comparative feedback from other machines I have

"

  Writing this review after 10 days of delivery of the laptop- Yes it is the best cheapest laptop- I did buy the laptop @17K- No heating issue till now(as laptop is new)- Battery works for straight 5 hours(pretty good till now)- speakers are loud and awesome- SSD is a great add on to speed as the laptop contain ceremon processor.- Screen quality and camera quality is too good.About S mode- I removed the S mode on the very first day as I need to install local softwares- I did install billing software(GST) which works smoothly- I did install printer drivers, zoom meeting software.- Till now laptops is very fast and smooth (Don't install heavy softwares)

  Light weight, stylish laptop good for basic office or house use, my daughter is happy to do her online classes and basic of coding. But one major issue is even though on the selling page it's written windows 365. And the buyer will assume that it's already installed like any other laptop, but this doesn't come with windows. And then one has to pay additional 5k per year. In that case it's total price will come closer to other branded laptop. One more thing which put me down is about there call center. If you have any issues or enquiries try to call God to help because the chances of getting a reply from God is more likely than Avita call center.

"
"

  Cute and LovelyI bought this mainly for its SSD hard discHighest resolution which you can't get from anyother laptop of this price and this screen sizeIt's a great idea that they've provided all the USB port, charge port, audio port behind the laptop.Works excellently with my favorite ubuntu OS( I removed windows)I don't use laptops for gaming

"
"

  Bought it for online classes and the worst thing is the camera is not working. Tried contacting the customer care through mail,phone, WhatsApp, Facebook and LinkedIn but no response whatsoever. Tried troubleshooting myself and found that there's no driver for the camera and the worst of them all is you can't even find the camera driver in their webpage itself. PATHETIC BRAND.. PATHETIC SERIVR.. PLS DON'T BUY THIS EVER..!!

"
"

  Within 4 days of use, the right hand side of the screen turned blank, see attached photo. This is a sub standard product that is being attempted to be sold on Amazon and will tarnish your reputation. I need this to be returned and my payment refunded.

"
"

  This is a perfect laptop for every day use. Light weight and performance adequate. Though with celeron processor it works really well. You can easily get out of S mode and do installation of your like. Prints very well and moreover it comes with 24 months on site warranty. It's a must buy for people with lower budget.Let's see how it evolves in coming months.

"
"

  I didn't checked before buying that it comes with window s mode, s mode is not allowing any other web browser to install. but there is option which showing purchase other browser.Laptop is very slow, wrost working experience. although i purchased it only for internet surfing but it is useless for me because its not allowing other web browser than microsoft edge.Also in it having window 10, three days i have used, window 10 is auto consuming my internet in internal updates, and 2 gb internet consumed in less than 10 minutes, what a rubbing product how i can use internet in this system.I try to uninstall window 10 and install 8.1 or lower version but it not allowing to install other windows version too.finally when i use microsoft edge browser with broadband so that i have unlimited internet, but when you open multi tab it always goes slow or hang or other pages stop working . what a rubbish product it is. my fault is i didn't used it within 7 days of purchase, i thought  it is looking good from body, it should be good, but believe me it is horrible, I wish to give it 0 star. now i want to return it to seller, i am not getting how to do.complete money waste!!!!

"
"

  Product z very Good..but...service vry worst in my area.....boy reckles answer.... irresponsible person

"
"

  I was sceptical about the celeron processor but was pleasantly surprised to see the clock speed it can maintain (around 2.6 GHz) without a fan!SSD makes the performance even better, arguably the best in the price segment.Added plus is windows 10 home bundled! Display brightness is average but quality is good and bezels are thin. Webcam position is awkward and makes you look like you're rolling your eyes as you look at the screen during a video call.Build quality is questionable, but there are bound to be tradeoffs.

"
"

  Laptop performance under satisfactory. Lags very much. Can't even use YouTube smoothly. I returned it but the service by Amazon was even worse. Waited for 3 weeks to get my refund!! Will suggest everyone not to buy this product.

"
"

  Good quality, good configuration and excellent warranty.

"
"

  It is a very nice product for this budget. Ordered it for online class and I am saying from my heart... It is a good product. Camera clarity is not that much good... But for students it is really good.

"
"

  From day one, have been experiencing many issues. Sometimes the trackpad isnt functioning, sometimes a few keys aren't working. The worst experience. Not even good enough to be used by kids.

   Overheating in just 15 mins. Processor is weak so system running slow. Experience very bad. Display good

"
"

  In it's range it is good product for general purpose tasks, not good for games, it's battery power is average ( not very good Or not bad). Due to SSD memory it's booting process is fast( take less time to start the computer) in compare to other computer in it's range. It is light weight(1.2 kg) small screen (14 inch) portal computer.

"
"

  I bought this in the Novembers of 2020, The product has served well beyond my expectation.Works brilliant and works super smooth despite SSD space occupied and applications running.very good for browsing, videos,  work , movies and lite gaming.Old games like gta san Andrea's, nfs mw, FIFA 11 and many more work super smooth.Its a thumbs up from my side for this product.

"
"

  I don't like this laptop.This is worse.Automatic mouse pad working without touching. Automatic right click working and search button automatic pressingBecause of this error I can't tolerate.Don't Buy this laptop. This laptop is malfunctioning.Don't buy... This laptop..

"
"

  What I feel that a laptop at a prize of tablet.I love it because all my needs are fulfilled by it.what else I want!

"
"

  Value for money  laptop is so good and everything is fine  but audio quality is not so good  overall product is  best for basic work

"
"

  Please don't buy this product. It's totally . Cam placed in bottom of screen that will get bad frame while taking pic or at video meet. In that we can't upgrade ram and also SSD. It's totally waste of money . Go with some others brands.

"
"

  Keyboad is very hard. Some keys are too hard to press. Called up Service Center for on site warranty as one key was not working. Called up 3 times. It has been one week. No one has come home to repair. Customer service sucks.

"
"

  Very very bad review from my side.Laptop shutdown automatically.Battery backup very very bad.I recommend don't but it. Please

"
"

  value for money...very fast responce being SSD drive and also battery backup is good around 5 hours . This product is real value for money

   Very good laptop bazzelfree and without lag and if you don't come out of s mode then you will never face heating problem also

"
"

  I got it this laptop at 16.5k. Value for money product.

"
"

  After 12 day its screen is not working. Screen is become white. Except small part of corner.very disappointing

"
"

  Display quality and performance - nobody can judge its price. High performance machine with great display.

"
"

  This is waste of money dont buy such product u will waste ur money instead buy a reputed ones with in month the laptop started gettingHanged i complaint on amazon they tells that u have to call avita  but their number is always not connecting totally waste of money

"
"

  This is an excellent laptop at this price serving purpose of e-learning, photoshop and small graphics work, ms office (I bought separately) , watching movies, regular business meetings etc along with origianl windows 10. Go for it, you won't regret.

"
"

  It's been 3 months since I'm using ,Working fine as per the expectation. You can't expect more from a laptop which cost you only 15k. It is good for normal internet uses and if you work on Microsoft office.

"
"

  They labelled that the laptop has aluminium body but it hs plastic , big scam 😓😓😓 i want my money back now.

"
"

  Good laptop..... Go for it... No competitor in this price range

"
"

  Good for small office use  but very fragile

"
"

  It's been 15 days now and I haven't face any challenges, there is no voice of a fan and even it won't get warm. I strongly recommend it to students and freelancers who are looking for a low-budget laptop, this is the only one you can have.

"
"

  Keyboard is not backlight.Webcam not that good. Rest speed, look and feel very good.Very reasonable for a normal user.

"
"

  ProLite waitOffice useFast booting good for office workOverall 8/10

"
"

  Superb quality. Display is awesome. Keys are very smooth. Performance is very good

"
"

  THE PRODUCT IS NOT AT ALL UP TO THE MARK, ITS GOING OFF WHILE USING.

"
"

  Good for general purpose use...Battery drains even on swtich off condition but good backup.

"
"

  Best laptop in this price...feels premiun and comfortable...not for gaming but good for daily work and study

"
"

  Working well, perfect pricing, value for money.

"
"

  1.The display is nice.2.The keypad is also good.3.The window is genuine.It's a basic one. Use it for basic purposes. Overall it's a good one.

"
"

  One of the best budget laptop for online classes and daily works like internet surfing and watching movies and videoIn my opinion this laptop is very useful and goodI just love this laptop

"
"

  Camera quality is very bad . It's like VGA camera. And the position of camera is not at good place , it should be at top . It has 2 minus points 1st camera quality and 2nd is it's position . We can't fix camera

"
"

  Excellent laptop by avita model essential great for home and office work as well online classes and price is amazing by Amazon and Appario retail

"
"

  Laptop is good but battery charging time is 3.5 hours.

"
"

  For beginners, this laptop best ...If you haven't used laptop then you should buy it...

"
"

  Not up to the mark.

"
"

  Motherboard is not working on 19th day of purchase. I am helpless. Cannot return also. Please help

"
"

  Value for money. Same as mentioned in description. Good for students

"
"

  The lap is good for users who works on web, ms office and other casual usage. As a charted accountant final student It was best for me to listen classes and manage office work.

"
"

  No cooling fans, hinch is very weak, all ports are back side

"
"

  For gamers this laptop not for them, screen size and display quality and camera quiet good but sound not so good

"
"

  Great product at this price. Awesome Display. Display Beats hp dell laptop even of 25k-30k price range. Beautiful Design. Nice performance and battery back up.

"
"

  Product is good but after 3 months of usage mouse scrolling touchPad is not working now

"
"

  Good product, but heating issu during using internet.Battery life normal.

"
"

  What a smooth beauty 😍

"
"

  Value for money....

"
"

  Fabulous product In this price range. Thanks you team avita And amazon. Valuable product.

"
"

  Waste of money not returnable..Amazon has to review this

"
"

  Very nice laptop and many functions and easy to use

"
"

  Amazing laptop. Love this. Value for money. Nice look and nice feature as per price.

"
"

  Dislike

"
"

  Unistall unwanted items like muktiple language package of ms office, keep one that you need. Remove unwanted browser plugin. Unistall unwanted preinstalled games, disabled start up programme like skype, ms edge etc. And see the performance. It will work like any other i3/i5 processor

"
"

  Bought the laptop this month.My review would be helpful for those who intend to improve the workability on the device.The laptop comes with 4GB RAM and 5400RPM HDD which is not great. The laptop is horribly slow... But with the 1x upgradeable slot (not an extra empty, but only slot), you can insert either an 8gb 2400mhz or 2666mhz ram. That helps the situation, but still not much.There is an empty M.2 NVME SATA slot. Insert an SSD and use Macrium to clone the current HDD to the SSD. Once done, enter the BIOS and change the boot order.Voila.. you now have a great laptop at hand. It starts to work smooth as butter.The laptop has inbuilt DTS sound software packed as an add-on within Realtek driver. But the output from the speaker is not upto the mark. Use the free version of FX sound to get around this problem as it amplifies the audio. Output on headphones is good.The camera is so-so, but you cannot do anything about it.In all, the laptop works good only if you upgrade the internals. Thats when you unleash it's potential.If you have no plans to tinker with the hardware of the laptop, I suggest you choose a different product.

"
"

  Please dont buy it..it is a worst product

"
"

  Best laptop For students

"
"

  Poor product specifications. 1st time machine had stopped charging all of a sudden so got the replacement but this one also is no better than the previous one. overall poor experience

"

  Hangs a lot and touch pad does not work smoothly

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  The laptop is light weight with not much powerful processor, but the best part is due to SSD the boot-up and shutdown time is 1-2 seconds. All the applications are working smoothly. Laptop comes with 1 Year Dell basic warranty, Genuine Windows 10 which needs to be activated, MS office 2019 student subscription and 15 Months McAfee antivirus subscription. Battery life is good and with moderate use can last upto 5 hrs. Overall a great product if you need laptop for your kid's online classes+homework and not for running Machine learning algorithms.

"
"

  Battery life and touch screen is good, but camera quality is ok.

"
"

  Nice product for kids

"
"

  Camera quality very poor

"
"

  And a very good performance laptop from Dell. For poor folks like me who graduate from a tablet to a laptop. Fast and crisp performance. Go for it if heaps of storage is not a issue for you.

"
"

  i didn’t get the invoice....

  Don't buy these product as it is total cheap qualityWaste of money

  इसे खरीदकर मैं खुद को ठगा सा महसूस कर रहा हूँ। 27500 रुपये का पूरा नुकसान हुआ। कंपनी ने हमें बेवकूफ बनाया। अगर सच कहूं तो कोई मुफ्त में भी दे तो भी ये लैपटॉप लेने लायक नहीं है। बिल्कुल बेकार प्रोडक्ट, ऐसी कोई समस्या नहीं जो इस लैपटॉप में नहीं है, इसे खरीदने से बेहतर है कि उस पैसे को कहीं दान कर दिया जाय।

"
"

  Does not have a built in wireless router. Got fooled by their marketing pitch. Pathetic. Need to buy separately. Disappointed. They are selling laptops without router. Real desperate sellers indeed. Imagine selling a laptop without internet connectivity. Laptop is Intermet readybut no internet connectivity so actually no Internet what soever

"
"

  I bought the laptop but its not charging by its charger at all..Brand new item having charger fault.And replacement by amazon not done in more than 10 days. Even  I am a prime user

"
"

  For whatever the price quoted it seems the performance seems to be ok. But, the display is not acceptable. Seems kind of cheap display and brightness controlling is very bad. It is too bright and it you try to adjust you can't see the content.Disappointed with screen.

"
"

  Totally wrost product. Don’t buy this product otherwise you’ll feel you have wasted your money on this product. I’m going to sell this product, if anyone interested contact me please.

  Laptop 15 Intel pentium Gold 6405u has pathetic processor is very slow one's you upload the windows 95% space is captured and system is getting slow.Customer service of HP Laptop is not promisable. I have ruined my 3 consecutive days to had whatsapp conversations and calls they not provided any solution.My time and money completely wasteSuggest to not buy HP Laptops with such bad service.

"
"

  1) Though processor is not premium, I wasn't expecting it to be too slow. Slowness is one problem.2) Wifi issue, I am not sure what contributes to this problem but it is there. I was able to connect to wifi initially and later after restart it was not getting connected. Very annoying. All the other devices at home are connected to wifi bar this annoying  laptop.3) What can you do with laptop without internet??4) I tried to leave review earlier but then amazon has removed this product from list.

"
"

  I exchaged this with my 3rd generation i5 laptop. And belive me it's faster.Petium gold is as same as 10th generation i3 processor.10th genration ,good screen,1tb ,4gb RAM, descent battery life, big brand value.You're getting these features under 26K.On of the Best laptop under the range of 35k.

"
"

  If you are a noob with the lap and you are into studies this thing is enough. Its a Pentium gold and sometimes it runs on space time and won't sync with Earth time.Need some time for heat up and then it's like -I'm speed.didn't tried gaming on it.Worth for what we pay comparing to market.we can't get i3 for this price and no Full HD display. So no choice. That's ur that's the my review on this.

  This laptop is slow in performance.It is heating up.I have tried all trouble shooter options to improve the function and succeded to so.e extent.I have over come the problem of heating by keeping it on a base with two extra fans.

"
"

  After using 7 days posting the review, worst performance too much of hang, battery life is not good, even camera not working.

"
"

  Good laptops but i don't suggest you to buy it if you are going to spend approx 26500/-. The laptop is slow .I'll suggest to buy i3 laptops (as you are going to spend 26500) or  buy Pentium Gold under 22000.

"
"

  The laptop is very slow. The body is not appear sturdy. the laptop plastic body go in when held from the sides. There is glue oozing out of the edges of the monitor screen.

"
"

  Hardware wise it's a perfect laptop. But after a week of use I'm disappointed that it's slow. Actually it's very slow.

"
"

  It's a good product.The battery life is to be extended and no issues about the material.

"
"

  It's hanging and taking more time to access. .. Windows 10 consume more RAM. So 4 GB ram is not enough ..I purchased in the month of February 1 at week...2 Nd week Onwards problem started.. Very disappointed

"
"

  Seller sent me a used laptop ,from touchpad any body can see the mark of using , build quality is very poor , I think it's a refurbished item , but company tells it's a new product. Very bad experience .

  The performance is very good and it is fast. All features are good and as per the cost price, it is value for money, can't expect more for this price. However, the webcam resolution is a bit weak not giving a sharper picture but all in all, can't complain. I suggest going for it.

"
"

  Its only been 9 days since I got this product and the screen goes entirely dark once the Lenovo logo disappears. There is no direct way to reach the seller or support helpline as well. The school starts in 5 days and due to this there is a genuine concern that my daughter might miss lessons. Someone needs to support and help asap

  Slim n thin laptop for badic daily use.. battery is average drains fast

"
"

  All are good but Adapter slot is not a fully insertable one. Only 1/3 part of adapter can be interested that is why almost part of memory adapter is seen outside.

"
"

  For the price of the laptop it is very good.

"
"

  Its battery backup is awesome. Not good for gaming. Its camera not good. Its trackpad is good

"
"

  Fast ssd version .go for it

"
"

  Its a worthy laptop and under budget product lack free and stream 4k videos on youtube also its so much under the price range

"

  This laptop comes without basic, m.s. office, which ends up giving every year cost of addtional 5000 plus to use this laptop

  It's a good laptop for basic need.  A bought this from my friends amazon account. Using this for last one week. It has good speed for doing MS office, photoshop qgis, google earth etc like software. Gaming I don't know.  Camera quality is average and disk space is OK only.  But It satisfies my professional need. Value for money.

"

  Pros1. Boots within 5 seconds (I bet u might have never seen anything like this before)2. “Ok Google” assistant like Siri3. Easy access like an android mobile phone4. Don’t be fooled this is not a tab, can access all android apps. Some inbuilt paid apps available for free.5. Gives Macbook like feel, fast charging and superb battery.6. Best for business travelers, presentation speakers, online teaching, learning, browsing.Cons1. Less storage capacity (usable is around 45GB only) but online cloud storage is available2. Meant only for document typing and browsing purpose, nothing much you can expect other watching movies.3. Its all Google and Google only.4. Beginners will find it a bit difficult to use this. Needs a bit of practice.5. No LAN port available. Only wifi.

  Screen is not upto the mark at this price point! Bad viewing angles, can see only yellowish tinge from any other angle other than the front!

"

  This Chromebook is perfect if you are looking for normal browsing,streaming. OS is very simple and very quick. Does the job very well. Touch screen is added advantage. Cloud storage is unlimited. so no issues.

  14a model chromebook is Touch screen and user friendly, no lagging observed. Supports all android apps. Camera is very good, have been using it for school zoom sessions.Cons:Keyboard is not backlit18gb occupied out of 64gb memory. So one need to use the memory card for extending to 256gb.

"
"

  The laptop arrived in a good condition and it was packed well. But it didn't have any receipt or warranty card inside even though a one year warranty is mentioned on Amazon. Please get back to me.

  1. Build quality is bad in general, plasticky. There are MIL tested variants out there for same price. Screen is wobbly and the machine is not built for a drop.2. Speakers begin to screech at high volumes.3. Other NA series models had back-lit keyboards. I bought this without verifying. My bad. But for a non-back lit keyboard, the design is bad and the letters are not visible. Im going to need to find stickers.4. Track pad works great.5. Screen is mediocre.6. Battery lasts all day as the processor has low power consumption. Overall performance is as predicted.

  Device is good looking and decent.The keyboard is plastic and flimsy and letters are not visible.Screen flickering on video calls or youtube and distortedNot all android apps are supported which is supported in android phone.

  Do not fall into the trap of buying this product, this is HP’s conspiracy to dump an inferior product in the name of a chromebook. Ideally windows laptop are supposed to be expensive because of the payout for the OS & hence Chromebooks are supposed to be cheaper. In spite of this arrangement this laptop feels cheaper than a 25k windows laptop with probably a bigger screen. My mistake of trusting a brand like HP blindfoldedly. Not to mention the pain of dealing with a defective product on top of it.

  The product is of very cheap quality and it does not support the commonly used Zoom app which is very much required in today’s Pandey situation.Poor

"
"

  overall the product is good ..thickness is very good......light weight ...and touch screen good....pubg gaming and cod gaming is not that good unless u add some graphic card or etc......the only problem is the display , but for this price range it is the best laptop for a collage students .........basic gaming is very good no lags ....and another problem is miscroft apps are paid apps , u need to buy them to use them......portable laptop......

  Overall good product to buy at this price range. Very much happy and easy to carry. It is good those who looking for normal usage of browsing, YouTube videos, small games with battery 🔋 backup of more than 12 hours if it is charged full battery.Pros:1. Good design and light weight. Easy to carry.2. Booting Speed less than 5 seconds.3. YouTube ads are default blocked by chrome OS and more convenient to watch YouTube videos like Premium without any charges per month.4. Very Good Battery 🔋 backup more than 12 hours.5. Browsing and touch screen is nice.6. Fast charging support.7. Price is less 25k budget Chromebook Laptop.Cons:1. Finding difficulty to type and save word document (Ex.,) Resume typing, etc., able to do only using online Google Docs and finds difficulty in Text alignment and copy to local harddrive, but feels not much convenient like Windows OS.2. If I connect my Samsung Galaxy A70 with Type C port, files are showing very slow, and not able to copy to harddrive. Instead of copy via Type C cable, I have copied via ""InShare Android App -> Web Sharing when connected to same WiFi"".3. Bluetooth Connection is failed frequently when we disconnected, we may needs to Reboot Chromebook again for restore connection, feeling very bad for this issue. Since, I am always use Bluetooth Speaker 🔊 for audio / playback.4. Not all Android apps are supported like mobile phones.5. Only low memory games supported otherwise, you will endup with Screen hanged up while loading the game.

  Best laptop under this price range .

  The Legendary chrome book,  that performs like a 2gb ram, (it's 4gb ram model ), I had to return the first one and since there's no option for refund,  had it replaced by another one,  thanks anyways,  second one same model is working fine but not the 4gb models performance,  updated it to latest version of chrome,  using it as daily driver,  since it's upgrade of my 2gb Acer chrome book which is still doing good,  this one's not up to the mark,  sorry Hp, I wasted 25k on this honestly,  buyers looking for Hp chrome book, Avoid all together!!

"
"

  Laptop is good with touch screen. But it is chrome os and can't install windows os so I wasted money buying this. They are not taking returning this product also 😔😔

"
"

  Good for students and employees who need laptop for office use like excel, ppt, etc. Not at all recommend for one  who are expertise especially in graphic design, animation, high end games etcc.ProExcellent touchscreenLight weightAttractiveFast100 gb Google cloud for 1 year.Mobile Google to laptop Google synchronisationDis advEMC hardisk that only 64 gbNot for high end users,.Not all android app are working in laptop

"
"

  This laptop is a perfect chromebook.1. Its battery life is amazing2. Cheap affordable touch screen laptop3. Can easily replace your windows laptop4. Runs almost same like your android phone5. More user-friendly than a windows laptop

"
"

  All is going well except  the google office software. Without registering any office software, it is difficult to work in excel, word documents. The manufacturer should note this and bring a free office software having all the features like windows version for the users.The bootup time is extremely fast. All the features of Android now are in laptop form.

"
"

  Best product for that cost . Not at all lagging camera is a bit low quality but that's okay. And starts really fast and everything is excellent .

"
"

  They are asking for than what this chromebook deserve it should be dil around ₹ 24k  because in USA its price was $ 279 which is around ₹ 22k. So dear seller please reduce price to atleast ₹ 25k. Who ever buying this for ₹28.9k or near is total stupid. Take my advice buy it for 24k its a good product but not worth paying 29k. Thanks!

"
"

  Sleek and light. Works better than any other Windows laptop in this price segment since Chrome OS is very much optimised. Browsing, surfing and streaming are fun on the go. Definitely, this one is not an option for seekers of intense computing but would be best for your daily work such as attending meetings and online classes (got a great camera quality). It supports most of the Android apps making it easy to get through things. The Intel Celeron N4020 & 4 gigs of RAM does it all. As far as memory is concerned. 64 GBs of SSD space is provided as well as 100 GBs of cloud storage for all which I find a little less. However, it's expandable to 256 GBs through micro SD cards.Overall, it's a great deal!

"
"

  Chromebook is not a matured product yet. Many apps which work on Android devices don't get installed on Chromebook or don't work similar to Android devices. This gap should be fixed by Google Play Store otherwise it's waste of investment on Chromebook ideology. Also keyboard missing delete button.

"
"

  Purchased this nearly three months ago, as a replacement for another HP Chromebook (which had it's own set of issues, but that's a whole other story).For starters, the screen is terrible. Speakers are tinny, and on the quiet side, never mind the B & o branding.The track-pad on my unit has developed an issue where it gets stuck, when pressed.Would not recommend.

"
"

  Chromebook is better than windows my children loved it but they should give laptop bag also overall very nice

"
"

  No. Don't waste money by taking this labtop, unless it will allow Windows operating system to install. It's just large version of mobile with bigger screen. There is no difference between this labtop & mobile. Unfortunately, I have wasted money by taking this labtop. Even company not provide microsoft office for free.

  I am writing this review after using 1week.Nice product my daughter loved it and very easy to use for kidsAdvantages1 slim and thin2 less wait and easy to carry3 os is fast4 download all android apps which supports to chrome os5 Battery backup superDisadvantagesLess storageCannot add widgetsLess usb ports

"
"

  Don’t buy this laptop if u want to do anythin more than watchin OTT platforms or YouTube. U can’t record PowerPoint presentations , Office 365 doesn’t work properly and the UI will drive u crazy

"
"

  I regret buying this, can't install important windows based applications and chrome OS is just useless.

"
"

  A very good product. The next day of my order the price of the product sky rocketed. May be it is such a valuable product that never again I saw its price coming down.

"
"

  User friendly, light weight and a nice product but my warranty slip is missing.

"
"

  It is not worth of money I want to  book another laptop

   Everything is great until low storage issue grabs your pocket for 256 gb memory cardOverall  it's a true thingMore like a smart phone with 14 inch screen and a keyboard.

"
"

  the product is reliably better at the price and best for surfing and writing, the cloud provides a dynamic role in storing and access ones work anywhere and anytime. the laptop provides a very decent presence before the friends.

"
"

  Very bad purchaseNo any purchase this laptopsVry bad.......Very bad....Very very bad....

"
"

  I was a educated fool to buy this, I request people not to buy Chromebook or notebook from any type of brands, they are just like a mobile, please kindly buy windows laptop

"
"

  Good one for school kids. If they are using Google classrooms it is seamless. Ver fast to load also can integrate android phone

"
"

  Very good product. Sleek and light weighted. Affordable and user friendly. Resolution of the screen could have have been better. Microsoft word isnt supported.... If one has to create a document file google doc or one drive can be used. Overall good product at this low price.

"
"

  not update in windows,not working in excel,word ,waste money

"
"

  Not good

"
"

  It won’t support to connect for prints. It’s not for any official use or personal use. It can be used only for kids use. Waste of money 👎🏻

"
"

"

  It is awesome battery is long lasting but backlight is absent and only 50 GB available for use please update it and make it 360° rotation

"
"

  Great laptop for easy low intensity work. Lightweight and then as advertised . Can’t handle lots of multitasking and multiple apps being used.

"
"

  Sir, I received the product, but it is incomplete, windows not installed. Now, I've to run here n there for it. Pen drive is not working. ROM is too less.

"
"

  The product worked for exactly 30mins during which i configured it and shut it downs. When i opened to restart the machine never turned on.  Such a disgrace

"
"

  The laptop is very well but the camera is very poor.

"
"

  Super! Bought for my son.works great.

"
"

  The laptop is good for the price.Battery backup, keyboard and trackpad are really good. Wish it had a 1080p screen, but can't complain at this price

"
"

  Like - light weight, touchscreen, quick startDislike - No backlight in keyboard, MS office is not included as specified

  Nice item but the keys should be more better

  Brilliant productMost of the configurations available in this price range (less than 40k) were either 4 GB RAM or 1 TB HDDMy base requirement was 8 GB RAM as Win 10 just doesn't work with 4 GB and going for aftermarket RAM on a new laptop did not make senseSecond requirement was SSD. I needed anything at or beyond 256 GBThird requirement was latest generation of processor, 10th Gen in this caseFourth requirement that kind of became mandatory after I was doing the diligence was MS Office preinstalled. Again, why go for aftermarket installation. Note: lot of people complain that this is only for 30 days. That's not the case. I activated just by signing in and updating Office.The only other competition to this is Lenovo in similar price bracket, but it has a poor camera. With all the online classes and office, you can't look like crap just because you have a camera dating back to 2000s. All else are either expensive, do not have SSD, do not have 8 GB RAM or MS Office.The screen could have been better, but I have a 29 inch LG screen so no complaints.I missed checking if the swivel opens 180 degrees and this laptop doesn't open 180 degrees, so if you do use dual monitor then you have to place  adjacent to additional monitorVery satisfied till now. Boot time with SSD is awesome, the system boots in under 10 seconds.Although it says 1.47 kg it feels a tad heavier.  I have been using Mac but that's twice the price.I wish there were more USB ports, it has 2 USB and 1 C typeThis is default choice in the specs/ requirements so best buy

"
"

  I've been using it for 3-4 days now. Experience wise it's great. It gets your work done.I'm not a gamer so can't comment on its gaming performance.Pros:8GB RAM helps windows 10 experience a lot.Light Weight.I don't consume storage space on my laptop so 256GB SSD is more than enough.Boots in less than 10 secondsWindows 10 & Office Student lifetime Subscription is a huge plus tooCons:The looks are pathetic.The display is very very very BADPlastic Body, Heck Plastic Trackpad feels very cheap.If you are able to make compromises on the cons then It's an average buy. Okay to use for work & study.Gets things done. I think it's the only 8GB product under 40K.Let's see .. I will update this review in a few months if the product still exists till then.

"
"

  First got the product delivered couple of days late. It worked fine for 1 week and then all of a sudden screen is gone ! Poor response from HP service centre ... they are saying screen must be physically damaged which is not the case at all and there after no update from last 3 days after constant follow ups ! So I cant use laptop anymore just 1 week after buying it! Poor Quality and worst service By Hp support !!!!!!!

"
"

  It's the worst product ever. First time when I ordered this, it stopped working after two days. Software crashed. (EROOR CODE 3FO)When amazon replaced this order, nothing worked in replace order. I couldn't access camera or internet. I mean it was horrible. One after I unboxed ans it was useless.Reading the other reviews, I see a trend in these laptop. They all are cranking a little while after use. Heavy software problem. HP should pull this profile r out of market and replace it with better models.I was lucky that I found the fault after two days ( in replacement, one hour). You might not be so lucky. What if these laptops stop working after 7 days days replacement policy overdue.You are stuck with a dummy for a laptop and you are 36k. Please make q proper decision and buy a better laptop. Just don't buy this one. I am telling you from my personal experience.

"
"

  Very good product in these range, under 40,000-i get it in 38,000 somethingIt saya 7hours battery life but it is near about 5hours , it's very good 👍.It take near 2 hours to charge fully.It has ssd , it starts in seconds.Good for light gaming 🎮 , light - average video editing.It take another hard drive for storage, after sometime.It's good in these price range, go for it. 👍😎It has 1 year warranty and you extend it by buying the extented warranty package for 14 15 series hp laptop.

  Worst product. Within one week boot volume crashed and one year HP support is awesome, I raised a complaint and after two weeks they said to contact nearest HP support center directly. It's been around one month I keep pushing the HP people but no one rectified my issue.It's not'HP customer care' it's'HP Customer DON'T care'.

  Web Camera quality is average, ok for light conference calls. Speed is decent and best part is the original and activated Windows 10 and MS Office 2019 Home & Student software. It is perfect for home use. Some people have posted that it is not FHD panel, rather HD (1366x768). But for Student or for parents it is perfectly fineNote: Product Delivery experience was the worst ever. Be prepared to have delay in delivery for absolutely no reason at all.

  Very light and thin.Best one within 40k.

  Good and affordable system from HP. The system come with loaded windows 10 and MS office. Slim and light weight the important things at low prices is the RAM which is 8 GB with i3 processor make the performance excellent. The battery back is more than 5 hours which is also food

  Super product by HP. Got this HP 14s cf3047tu at Rs 35990 on great indian sale. Awesome Performance! Writing this review after 1 week of usage... Here is the detailed review of the product..Battery backup is impressive. If you are not a heavy user it can last for a day. ( 9/10 )Performance wise it's a beast.. with 8GB of ram, i3 10th gen processor and SSD storage you will not face any problem related to speed and performance. Windows boots in just 6-7 seconds. The software or apps takes max of 3 seconds to load... I have not faced any lagging issue till now. ( just avoid high end softwares and games and your laptop will work like a charm ) (10/10 )Display is also good... I don't know why people are complaining about it. Also bezels are not too thick as in dell vostro and others. (8/10)Looks are also decent with patterned surface which feels amazing to fingers and also provides a good grip. (8/10)Sound is AWESOME! at 100% volume it feels like i am playing music over a Speaker... It is really loud. You'll have to keep volume at 40-50% for general use.You'll not get any other laptop with this sound quality at this price. Really! (10/10)Camera is Average or you can say good for video calling purposes... As you don't have to take selfies with it.So finally, This laptop is good in every feature. A power packed machine by HP. You will not get any other laptop with this type of performance, speed, sound and battery for this amazing price. Better than vivobook 14, vostro and ideapad series. Just Go For It!Overall rating 9/10.(you also get a lifetime version of MS Office 2019 home & student - powerpoint, word, excel & one note which comes preinstalled with it that is you just have to sign in with ms account in any of the application and you will unlock the office suit)Also a big thanks to Amazon. They delivered it within 2 days of ordering.- vivek 😊

  Its just around 10 days since we bought the laptop.  Today as we were working it showed ""HDD 3FO Error"" on bootup.On BIOS tool it says storage volume is not present!!!Have raised an issue with HP for technician visit.  Hope they could solve it!!!Not sure it is an one off problem or general issue with this model.

"
"

  Pros: The product is amazing as it has 8gb Nvme ram and 256gb SSD storageIt boots up within seconds and is very fast, It comes with pre installed MS Office and Student editon which is a boon for students.Cons: Not so good webcam  And marks on the laptop when  we touch it but it is manageable at such a good price range of approx 39k INROVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU THIS LAPTOP.

"
"

  This is the worst product ever. DO NOT BUY.I bought this laptop in Sep 2020 and the laptop stopped working within one month. Amazon is refusing to take return and replace this product.For the past 2 months I’m trying to get the laptop fixed through HP service. Most pathetic service. They close the tickets immediately without resolving the issue. Despite repeated requests, they are not sending technician to fix the issue.Getting no warranty support or technical support.

"
"

  Before buying this product please make sure you this. We have decided to buy this product the first ever problem was it was enabled to connect with router and second thing it get's hang frequently which only brought before a month. We have consulted the hp services they are were will be responsible of ntg as you brought it from Amazon. If we consult this Amazon these people are asking us to contact hp people. 35,000 matters it not 10 for our middle class people. Even if like have any exchange these would allow choose any options. Please before buying any electronic goods make sure that the company and also refund policy are good otherwise there would be lot of problems to be faced just like did

  # 8gb Ram, 256gb nvme SSD at a decent price point is a great deal..# laptop is pretty thin and light, good for carrying around and regular usage.# Has good processing speed due to nvme ssd n 8gb Ram installed in it..# Lag free windows 10 experience# Comes bundled with student/home ms office, just need to activate it.# Looks and build quality are moderated but decent enough for the given price point.# Display quality as mentioned by some of the buyers isn't that bad either, i could hardly notice any problems in it..# Has got a good sound quality.

"
"

  This isn't review after 3 days of Use.Pros: Very thin and light.  Easy to carry  Battery backup is good 5-6hrs  Boots up in less than 10secs and b  shutdown in less than 3secs  8gb ram+256ssd makes the laptop super  smooth and fast.  Sound output is good.Cons: Camera is average. Not Very great.  No backlit keyboard.  Track pad could have been more smooth  but a mouse will do the work.Overall: Great Laptop for 35000 price range. Best for students, office use,  etc.Rating 8.5/10

"
"

  Worth the investment.  Got this with an exchange offer and got it for 30k. Great for business and home use. Not recommended for games or heavy duty data processing works.1. Light weight2. Quick bootup thanks to SSD.3. Mat finish, keyboard quality is great4. MS office 2019 comes free5. Audio quality is above average6. Video streaming and display is quite good7. RAM can be upgradable up to 16gb but may have to let go 4k *2 rams  DIIMs8. Hard drive cannot be expandable, need to replace.

"
"

  Purchased this as replacement for my aged HP ProBook 440G1. Replaced an i7 with this i3 option for these reasons: Latest technology -11 Gen, 2021 model, SSD, 8GB RAM. Did not want to spend a lot as I have a Surface Pro. Got 12k in exchange for the 440G1. So this fit all the bills. First impression of product is good. Plastic feel was the only putoff, but you can't expect a metallic body at this price. Laptop doesn't feel very sturdy for the plastic body. Booting / Shutdown is very fast because of SSD. 8GB RAM is min required for decent Windows 10 performance. Screen resolution is good. Very lightweight so you will not mind it carrying around. Easy to activate both windows and MS Office with instructions given on product page in Amazon. Overall, a decent product that won't dent a hole in your pocket. Would have given 4 star had the body been metallic and sturdier.

"
"

  Amazing speed, at first I had issues with start menu response but later fixed by update. Only laptop in the range with 8Gb ram. Keyboard is perfect as the button's stiffness  is well manged. Very light and almost negligible bezels. Only problem is the display which is HD and not FHD, although resolution  doesn't  make much difference but the inaccurate colour reproduntion and lack of Antiglare coting makes it an average display. Battery life is 6hrs + once full, charging is fine alomost 2 hrs. Overall I cant find a better laptop in this range.

"
"

  Before you go for this product, also keep in mind that how much money you spend on this laptop.After exchange, I got it at 32k.At this price, it's more than I expected.Intel i3 processor is enough for my needs. I even run VMs with 2 core. I don't want to launch 3-4 VMs so that's reasonable for me.SSD and 8GB is very quick and smooth operations.Genuine Windows and Office is a plus. One less thing to worry about.Last, Amazon is very good that it got delivered same day...

"
"

  Writing this review after 1 month of usage.Purchased for 36k and here are few observations:(I am not a tech guy, but who use laptop for regular day to day usage)- Installation can be done by self and not required to avail the Amazon service at additional cost.- Ideal for School/college students/ regular users with not much of technical work to do.- Not ideal for Gaming purposes.- Decent booting speed & No hanging issues encountered so far- Video streaming apps load decently, the streaming quality is Okayish.- No keypad light available.

"
"

  After 1 month of use,1. display is blinking2. and bios boot issue appeared.3. Power button doesn't work some times... You need to hold for seconds4. Only advantage of this laptop is thin and fast boot due to ssd.5. Least quality Graphics6. My final advice is... Go for different models.. This is built with least quality material. And motherboard  doesn't support even small applications... Dell inspiron models are seems best as I used it earlier.

"
"

  The product which we received was really bad. Problem was faced with WiFi connectivity. Initially it get connected with WiFi and then automatically get disconnected.

"
"

  Its been a week , so far so good. Only disadvantages are the screen's viewing angle are terrible and back lit keyboard is a must for laptop which costs more than 35k.Apart from these issue it is one hell of a laptop in the price point and its super light and compact with a decent battery backup of 5hrs + for now although I guess it will fall to 3hrs in around 6 months time as per my experience with Hp( Finger Crossed ) .

"
"

  Review is for the 10th gen i3 - 2 core model laptopProsCompact  size / weight to carry around.Windows 10 Home for life time.Office 10 (I guess that is only Word, PowerPoint and Excel) but for single user .Has Ethernet LAN connectivity (newer models do not have this).8 GB RAM (contrary to the 4 GB mentioned on HP site for this model)  which will give good performance .256 GB SSD storage, improves speed and handles shocks.ConsA little reflective screen.No DVD drive.Both  the legacy USB Connectors as well as Power Supply  connector are on Right hand side while 1 USB .Type C USB connector is on left hand side.Wifi speeds are only upto 150 Mbps,  though YouTube streaming experience was good without any lag.

"
"

  In less than a month, the laptop failed while in operation. The SSD hdd is not accessible although the diagnostics indicate the disk is fine. From the reviews, it appears the laptop model has inherent problem & hence should be called back by hp and replaced with functional/tested models. Other features like light weight & thickness are overridden due to these failures leading to data loss.

"
"

  Bought this laptop during about 3 weeks ago during the Navratri sale offer. Delivery was quite prompt, got it properly packaged the very next day.Usage wise quite satisfied. Battery backup is also good.Regarding display, am satisfied for regular googling / reading, even watching a movie is decent. Screen was not very clear during a Zoom call.So overall am quite happy with this laptop for regular use.

"
"

  Look no further if your budget is 36K, close your eyes and buy it. 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and I3 10th Gen with MS OFFICE-License configuration you won't get it anywhere else. It boots in just 5 Sec with super fast performance. Initial Setup is very easy and you can do it yourself. Also if you follow Video uploaded by seller, registering MS OFFICE License is also easy. Display and Camera is ok (not best). Speakers are loud and clear. Overall a great buy.

"
"

  It's a pathetic product. Very bad build quality looks fragile. Never expected such kind of product from HP that is too through Amazon. The quality is highly detoriated and.when I am asking for the return through refund Amazon Customer Care people are giving absurd policy reference. I am contemplating on approaching the Consumer Court for the redressal of the issue.

"
"

  Overall experience is good as expected. Performance is mind blowing I just bought this laptop for coding and personal works. This is only products with 10gen ssd and 8 gb ram within 40k range. I am using HP laptop for 8 years that's why I chose HP laptop only. Those who are looking for laptop for study and personal purposes can consider this product.Booting speed: 4.5/5Camera: 4/5display: 3.5/5lightweight: 5/5charging: 5/5battery backup: 4.5/5overall: 4.5/5

"
"

  Speed is fast. Very quick boot time.Build is average. But performance was very good after initial 3-4 days of usage.Need to have Microsoft account in order to activate the laptop first time. Also it's required to activate the MS office product which comes pre installed with laptop.If you have opted for old laptop in exchange then delivery might get delayed as in my case they could not arrange and it got delayed by 2 days.But overall experience with laptop is good. Battery back up satisfactory. At least for 4-5 hours. Camera quality is average. Sound is good. Since it's ssd, much faster than traditional hdd.

"
"

  I have been using this device for almost 3 months. For the price there aren't many laptops under 40K with offer 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, and Office as well. This laptop has some good compromises for the price. No backlight keyboard but a good, comfortable keyboard. No FHD display but a decent battery life. The SSD speeds are pretty fast as well. So a fast boot up. Speakers are also decent.Overall, I use it everyday for work and no problems till now.

"
"

  This is an amazing product for liye coders. Who are noob in coding they can try this lappy.SSD- because of ssd the timing of loading am operation and opening the os is little faster.RAM 8GB- 8 GB ram is enough for specific coders. It is good for multitasking. But don't try this if you are a heavy gamer or heavy coder.KEYBOARD- keyboard is greally good. Easy for typing but there is no numpad.TOUCHPAD- a fine and smooth touchpad with mat finish which is appreciatable.Screen- Full hd and 14 inch. You may find it a little small but still it is very much clear.OS - windows 10 is preloaded in SSD. Therefore the machine is faster than others.MS OFFICE- ms office is also preloaded. You need not to buy or download it.HARD DISK- 1 TB hard disk is there.LAN PORT- LAN port is given.USB PORT- only 2 USB port at your right side.SD CARD PORT- available at left side.CHARGING POINT- at your right side.HEADPHONE POINT- at your right side.CAMERA- camera is quiet okay for normal video calling.KEYLIGHT- Keyboard light is not available.Battery- you can use it up to 6 hrs.All over you can buy this if you are a lite coder. But not recommended to heavy gamer or coder.

  After going around shopping at shops for a 8 GB Ram +SSD +i3 11 gen specs I met very high quotes and low spec config models from various popular brands.Finally this purchase met all my expectations and fit my tight 40k budget.Windows+office was a bonus highly recommend.

  I m writing this review after using for about nearly two months . So i bought hp i3 8th gen 8g 256gb ssd model . Im a college student casual user only for powerpoint and browsing only i decided to go for it .Basically i was using old model of hp laptop only with amd old processor which gave lot of problems i cannot able to use that for simple one. I searched compared with other laptop also .when i bought i purchased for 36k i dont know why price been increased while that time some of the model like asus laptop avita were good also they were not some thing to look like asus had 4gb ram and typically having hesitant to with amd ryzen processor.This laptop till now basically fine it will feel compact also microsoft office free version preinstalled that also major advantage there are some things to be look after like:- Only one time i faced lag or hang i dont know  why i had put my pen drive so due to that may be i faced other than that i didnt hang problem.-While update notification the laptop like flickering the screen blackish that i also faced twice after updating it will not come.-Also keyboard also it  good feel will not comfortable to type it will feel cheap feel quality but mousepad feels fine. it necessary to wireless keyboard .-while turning pressing power button for turning on the laptop i feel that i have to press 2 times for that i dont know why but boot time is like 3 seconds .These are all things that need to be considered although it is not a major con somehow have to check with that.Performance is decent normal use whilw i played wcc2 game that feels like hiccups happened anyhow it is a decent processor no heating problem or fan noise i didnt heard of till now.Another thing that everyone should after is that battery backup the battery capacity mentioned like 41 or 42whr so claiming less than 7hr majorily i also one of the reason i bought but decent battery backup only charging also take less than 2hrs last 5 percent takes time little battery backup at a stretch use u will less than 4 hrs only.Screen quality is hd only it is decent enough.FINAL VERDICT: Overall i suggest for buying this laptop mainly should be based on price only for 42k we can get better laptop also ig u get a price of 35 to 38k it will make much sense and value for money.Also mi laptop learing edition will be there still it is not that available there are not that much review i didnt go for it . other than it is only available above 40k better buy mi laptop with i5 gen or asus laptop mainly there will be i3 only it will be available Regard with amd processor in amd ryznen 3 or 5 are available in avita brand or some other company also but still not suggest only in case of heating or battery draining issue this with old experience of processor also review of other laptop only im saying.U can buy hp mi acer and asus with ssd option better value .Also thing this laptop im not sure about we cant add ram or expandable that thing need to check after in cas of mi laptop im sure that is not upragable.

  What the hell this laptop isWorst laptopNever ever dream to buy this wasteIt automatically starts burning when charger was pluged in and got fully burntGot dead within one month of purchaseNo support from hp

"
"

  Best laptop with great specifications:8 GB RAM/256GB SSD.Battery life: More than 6 hours make it more valuableSound Quailty is amazing. No need of extra speakerCould be more better:Display (view angle not that ,much impressive)Keyboard Quality should improve with metallic finish instead of low quality plastic (On this prize segment, it makes complete sense)

"
"

  Product description does not mention anything about screen resolution. If you blindly expect a Full HD screen you will end up having a a semi HD screen.

"
"

  I bought this laptop for my kids for online classes. But seems I can also do my office work using it. You cannot get better than this under 35k with good brand name.Pros:1. Thin & Very light weight2. Very fast processing and no heating3. Build is good in this price rangeCons:1. No anti-glare screen

"
"

  I am writing this review after 12 days of use. over all good laptop. Boots in hardly 3 sec. Scree quality is good.Only point here is McAfee. when laptop delivered to me by that time free subscription was alreay ended. May be it was on when they installed OS n all

"
"

  It is better product for those who have the budget under 40000, its processing Power excellent. Startup 10to15 seconds. 8k videos are run comfortably. Battery backup upto 4-5hours. Mice good. Speakers excellent. Overall performance good. I suggest it for the students who require laptop. Only the problem is that there are only two USB ports , should have been three.

"
"

  Laptop works like jam, superb in daily task,But it has pathetic screen resolution and contrast, you have to work hard to see this, even my 11 years old dell laptop scr6een much much better and clear than this.Amazon customer services planned three times technician supervisor visit at home BUT no one to came for it.

"
"

  The price is great for the specs, performance is great. However the display is terrible, even my 2011 Dell laptop display is 10 times better. Only compromise is display, else great at 37k

"
"

  This laptop is excellent for budget programmers! I could easily run Pycharm, VS Code and close to 8 tabs of Chrome simultaneously without any lags. Boot time is excellent owing to 256GB SSD. Glare does exist but, well you are getting this at about 35k, so some faults do exist. Also camera quality is poor, but again I actually never felt the need to use it frequently.Also if you ask about gaming, then I just had tested Prototype 2, and it did work fine enough even at high settings.The fact that you get lifetime access of Microsoft Office and Student 19, is a huge plus point.

"
"

  Thanks Amazon for early delivery.A very satisfying product from hp. Quality of aesthetics are really good , especially as I was little apprehensive on that while ordering.Slim and compact design makes it comfortable to carry it along even within the house.Functional aspects are fine.

"
"

  Laptop has started showing problem just after 1 week of delivery. My niece is using this laptop and now screen has become green and nothing is working. We raised complaint to HP India but no one has arrived to repair the laptop. I have bought 3 HP laptops with different models in 1 year but all have some issues.

"
"

  Like to sum up in few points:•Very compact•Crisp screen•Snappy performance (Thanks to SSD NVME)•Battery life good•easy to carry•Decent sound quality

"
"

  Good laptop. Boots in seconds. Ideal for those who do not store too much of data on laptop. Even if u want to change laptop frequently its better to have a separate HD drive.

"
"

  I purchased This laptop for my son who is pursuing 12 th so he can use for his project work.This laptop broke down twice.. 1 st instance was on 2 nd January 2021 .. I logged in a complaint with HP and again same problem OS is getting crashed and data is erased completely. Kindly provide a permanent solution to me.

  i3 10th Gen., with 8GB RAM & 256 GB SSD makes this a very fast machine. Only I wanted this config with 15"" screen, but not regretting getting a 14"" with this laptop.

"

  So I've used it for 2 days . According to me it's a good choice in this price , well i bought it from this seller itself at 26990 , now the price is shown 31000 .still it's great choice because in the Shop's in my town it's priced 35000 .so now performance , it does what it says , lag free smooth operation i tried 4k video which were stuttering in the i3 desktop in my friends house , it worked in the lap like we used to play 720p in my friends i3 desktop , i skipped many times quickly but never shown a bit of lag etc.. it was smooth and responsive . The build quality was also nice and lightweight . The dolby audio was clear as said . The camera was 0.3mp only . Well can do video call but not a clear hd video call. Screen was also very good after the updating of the graphics software (from windows update) . because when we get the settings are tuned in for power , it Last for around 6 hours with movies , software etc.. effortlessly . But i updated the graphics software and tuned to for maximum visual appearance , still it Lasted 4 hours with all sorts of usage including video editing apps , 4k video playback etc... The screen is mat Which is very nice , but in outdoors at noon etc the brightness may feel a bit not enough , but in indoors etc it's clear . It comes preloaded with windows 10 home latest version so windows update won't use much data , it's activated lifetime . It also has office 360 trial ! . and McAfee antivirus trial ! .i already had a key of office 2016 so i installed it amd activated it works smooth . also i had subscription of Kaspersky so switched to it . It has 1tb hdd ,two 3.2 usb port and one 2.0 usb port .one slot for sdcard , slot to add a ssd and a extra ram ,a HDMI port . The package contained laptop ,and charger ,and guarantee slip .the user manual must be downloaded from internet a qr code is provided to download it .i bought the ryzen 3 version . so that's my review in quick glance.i'll update as i remember. If i missed anything .

"
"

  Laptop looks fine. Delivery etc all well. But the edges are so very rough that they have bruised my hand after an hour of usage.Oddly amazon doesn’t recognise this as a defect and refuses to return/replace.

"
"

  Very poor quality plastic. Locks broke when back was opened the first time. Screws sheared out of surface when I tried to fit them back. All USB ports at one side make it uncomfortable to use sometimes.

"
"

  I bought it for my wife's father, she paid. :)This product is perfect for the purpose it was bought. He is a tutor and during the pandemic he couldn't teach properly as he didn't have sufficient devices. This solved a lot of issues for him. Very happy to see him continuing his classes through online platforms again.One small thing happened is that within 2-3 months the audio port stopped working yesterday, where one puts in the headphones jack.

"
"

  Using arround one month. The product is working fine. Battery backup also good.

  This is a VFM laptop. Plastic body and screen vobbles due to plastic hinges much like Avita Pura laptop does.Windows 10 pre-installed but Office does not come alongsideAbsence of SSD drive makes it bit slow, you can upgrade SSD though by spending bit more.Updating after 2 days of usage:Speaker volume is very low. Speakers not good enough for hearing out clearly in online classes. You will need to attach external speakers to it.

  So I've used it for 2 days . According to me it's a good choice in this price , well i bought it from this seller itself at 26990 , now the price is shown 31000 .still it's great choice because in the Shop's in my town it's priced 35000 .so now performance , it does what it says , lag free smooth operation i tried 4k video which were stuttering in the i3 desktop in my friends house , it worked in the lap like we used to play 720p in my friends i3 desktop , i skipped many times quickly but never shown a bit of lag etc.. it was smooth and responsive . The build quality was also nice and lightweight . The dolby audio was clear as said . The camera was 0.3mp only . Well can do video call but not a clear hd video call. Screen was also very good after the updating of the graphics software (from windows update) . because when we get the settings are tuned in for power , it Last for around 6 hours with movies , software etc.. effortlessly . But i updated the graphics software and tuned to for maximum visual appearance , still it Lasted 4 hours with all sorts of usage including video editing apps , 4k video playback etc... The screen is mat Which is very nice , but in outdoors at noon etc the brightness may feel a bit not enough , but in indoors etc it's clear . It comes preloaded with windows 10 home latest version so windows update won't use much data , it's activated lifetime . It also has office 360 trial ! . and McAfee antivirus trial ! .i already had a key of office 2016 so i installed it amd activated it works smooth . also i had subscription of Kaspersky so switched to it . It has 1tb hdd ,two 3.2 usb port and one 2.0 usb port .one slot for sdcard , slot to add a ssd and a extra ram ,a HDMI port . The package contained laptop ,and charger ,and guarantee slip .the user manual must be downloaded from internet a qr code is provided to download it .i bought the ryzen 3 version . so that's my review in quick glance.i'll update as i remember. If i missed anything .

  Laptop looks fine. Delivery etc all well. But the edges are so very rough that they have bruised my hand after an hour of usage.Oddly amazon doesn’t recognise this as a defect and refuses to return/replace.

"
"

  Very poor quality plastic. Locks broke when back was opened the first time. Screws sheared out of surface when I tried to fit them back. All USB ports at one side make it uncomfortable to use sometimes.

"

  I bought it for my wife's father, she paid. :)This product is perfect for the purpose it was bought. He is a tutor and during the pandemic he couldn't teach properly as he didn't have sufficient devices. This solved a lot of issues for him. Very happy to see him continuing his classes through online platforms again.One small thing happened is that within 2-3 months the audio port stopped working yesterday, where one puts in the headphones jack.

"

  Using arround one month. The product is working fine. Battery backup also good.

  Got this gift from my dad. Amazing laptop under 30k budget. Great speed and battery.

"

  I bought 3 same laptops (Lenovo Ideapad S145 AMD Ryzen 3 3200U) for 3 kids for school purpose. From day 1 it was very slow to setup and operate.I have uninstalled all non-required apps, and kids are only using chrome browser to use ""Google classroom"" which is a very simple website and dont require any extra resources.Still this computer is very very slow and always feels tired.I have spent 90K on these 3 machines 6 months back, and feel would have opted for something better.Not recommended at all

"
"

  We purchased this laptop in June and its not working now. this is very unexpected thing happened. Only 4 month laptop worked properly. We are not happy ☹️ after buy this.this is the result of lenovo laptops third class quality.........This our first laptop and we decided to buy Lenovos but now we not trusr on Lenovo will never gonna buy a product of lenovo.....That's it

"
"

  Mostly review about battery related so i cancelled this.  if laptop not gives minimum 5 hour backup so its not got to buy.

"
"

  Bad quality product. Especially the display cable. The build looks too cheap and have far less features as compared to others in the same price range.

"
"

   This laptop sucks even for basic use like video watching and ms office (it doesn't come with ms office you have to buy it or download pirated version). If you are on a tight budget, you can buy this and then install a ssd and aditional 4 gb ram stick to make it usable. Heats quite a bit after 30 mins of continuous usage. Integrated graphics reserve around 800 MB of ram due to which only 3.4 GB of ram is usable. So an additional ram stick is must. Dual core processor is on the weaker side, fans get ramped up quite a bit which is annoying.The only pro i can think of is the screen quality which is decent according to the price(note that brand has cut corners to give full hd panel at this price). If you are a programmer stay away from this machine and build a PC(you can build a great PC at 25k).

  Need to update ram to 8gb for best performanceGta 5 runs well after upgrading ram

"
"

  Wanted a good laptop for daily usage with Windows and Office. The performance is good and does the everyday tasks well. Comes with Microsoft Office as well. Very happy with the purchase at this price.

"
"

  Awesome laptop in this range. It is truly value for money. Dynamic Physical look. It is very good for work from home in this epedemic covid-19.

"
"

  I bought this product but when i open its lid its turn on automatically.... is it defective product or its ok? Let me help to know that

"
"

  The product description clearly mentions that MS Office Student Home 2019 is Pre-installed. This was one of the reasons for selecting this laptop. However, on activation it shows that MS Office is available for only upto 20 September 2020. This is unfair selling practice.

  I was expecting some basic experience but it struggles a lot. My HP pavilion with 2.2GHZ works better than this. I was like oh god what I have did, because I have exchanged my pavilion to get this.but now, 3rd power on after driver updates, BIOS update, now 2004 version is downloading, it's better ( only a nominal paise better)but I need to keep considering the price and it has camera and Mic which my pavilion does not have.To get this far, I need to apply Windows improve performance support link on new laptop with AMD ( I do not know what happened to AMD ( might be they are concentrating on other things where Intel dominates).I truly disappointed with this performance. Every time I click I click I click, I need to wait. In edge browser typing like stuttering.Think Edge is like that ( which is lightest) than any browser for Windows.The display is glare glare glare if you do not have proper lighting.I use on natural light, even with 20 watt LED room light, it glares.so far, as it was mentioned in the product pictures, the AMD Athlon version is tablet replacement and it is complete 15.6 inch ( need to check diagonal).I saw one review with horizontal measurement so clarifying others who check reviews before buying it.It has integrated RAM 4GB, usable 3.38GB and 1 TB Seagate usable 930GB.Over all, I'm keeping as it serves my purpose and basic working laptop with Windows home OS and Office 2019 ) the software's itself comes close to the laptop price if it bought separately.The funny part, I have HP omen Rs.1Lakh and above, this laptop I bought for R.22,000, my family likes this one than Omen since it has brushed aluminum like feel platinum grey compared to Omen matte black.Update 24/10/2020.Now, the laptop seems to be better.After 2004 update installed, I have 1.4GB RAM left for other applications.Total 4GB RAM > user available 3.38 GB ( pathetic) I don't know the user available is so low due to RAM is directly soldered to the Mother board. Windows only uses 1.9 to 2GB.but anyhow, I need to upgrade RAM or user experience might not be best.Update 07/11/2020.I need to upgrade the RAM if not, the user experience would be like order coffee and get it by tomorrow but you need it today.The display is like kind of white (eee) not balanced sharpness/contrast and brightness. I use it for my work and rest is Netflix, Amazon prime and movies collection I have.The exceptional part of this laptop is sound. Yes, the sound. The sound is best, way better than any computer ( I should say) or is it because of Dolby atmos.Yes, I'm typing it in the middle of the movie to praise the sound quality.and yes, I could conclude to myself Dolby atmos is better than DTS X with Bang & Olufsen . Yes, it is. Hail to Dolby.Update 15/11/2020,Installed 4GB 2400MHZ RAM, even though this model compatible up to 12GB RAM since it has 4GB onboard RAM (soldered directly to the motherboard) I'm forced to use 4GB RAM.If I use 8GB RAM + 4GB onboard RAM, I get the average of these 2, which could 12/2=6GB RAM which is now my usable RAM 4GB RAM added + 4GB ono board RAM.Yes, the performance is increased. Additionally I set Windows search indexing to manual so yes the performance is far better improved. Tested multiple application simultaneously.Windows explorer + Edge ( 2 tabs)+ Chrome (2 tabs) + Task manager + Excelall the applications worked better than earlier ( pl.refer my earlier review in the above messages).Note: Total 8GB installed RAM, 2GB allocated to integrated GPU as a dedicated RAM which is the beauty and welcome thing I like. Since the laptop has integrated GPU comes with 512MB dedicated RAM ( occupies the RAM installed or shares the 4GB RAM installed)Now, the integrated RAM increased to 2GB which would help me in running GTA V at low settings easily.and 8GB+ 4GB =12/2 usable RAM would be around 10 or 11GB but the performance would be equal to 6GB.When we are using dual channel memory, we need to always equip same amount of RAM to get same amount of performance.Suggestion to Lenovo: Please provide at least onboard 6GB or 4GB fully usable RAM.To buyers, buy RAM along with the laptop. Seriously it meets the requirements and need.All these reviewing are done with power adapter connected and Extreme performance mode.The thing I feel could be provided better is the display.The thing I feel wow about this product is the sound.

  Awesome product,delivered with full safety,good battery backup (5hrs+),attractive design,you may go for this.Best for students got it for ₹25,643.But there is no fingerprint unlock, only a power button.

"
"

  okay... since its not THAT expensive of a laptop...  but still atleast put the right info!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it says that the battery will be working for 5 hours ... when all i do is open gmail for only 3 hours ;... i need to charge the laptop again even when i started working at 100 % within 2.5 hrs i need to charge it again........... baddddd ... realllYYYY BADDDD

"
"

  It is good laptop. Some people are telling that its processor is too slow and not working properly. If you buy a laptop under 26k and you want processor like 35k laptops then forget it.Under 26k it is very good laptop having slim and stylish design overall i would suggest u that you can buy this laptop.

"
"

  At such price the laptop is good for basic office work and some online browsing work. Also good for students for online learning, teaching.Please verify first while purchasing the device for compatibility of software you are going to use.Also the warranty mentioned is from 28th September 2020 to 27th September 2021. But the device is purchased on 17th October 2020. And on 18th October after it received I have completed the first time registration process. So warrenty is there.Also after two days of use the battery life is about 2 hours for full charge.

  I brought this laptop and after just 10-12 days this laptop started showing slowness. It takes 20 minutes to just start and then you can start working.Its worst than our desktop of year 1999-2000 eraWhen I tried checking the issue it’s showing disk utilisation 100% while I am having less than 100gb data in 1 TB CAPACITY hdd.I have Mcafee Total protection license to protect this device which is recommended by Lenovo themselves.I will never ever recommend such a useless product to even my enemy.I have all laptops till date I brought from Lenovo but after this experience I must say I feel like getting cheated by LENOVO and dealer.Its better not to sale such products which are not worth using a day.DO NOT BUY EVEN YOU DONT CARE ABOUT MONEY, it’s as good as you are buying garbage for 22K.

"

  Laptop was awsome.packaging was good. .at this price range below 26k it's a best laptop.thank you Amazon.

"

  It was said it has ms office home and Student 2019 but it was not there in the laptop only the trial version given then I had to contact lenovo and microsoft for this, microsoft said that they need ms office home & student 2019 mentioned on the invoice also as on the invoice amazon has mentioned only ms office 2019. I faced lot of problems because of this u had to continuously call amazon, lenovo, microsoft on this issue. amazon was not ready to provide any confirmation at first whether it had ms office 2019 the finally after calling for two days I found one customer care executive in leadership team who helped me by sending me a mail which included all the details of the laptop plus she mentioned it has ms office home and Student 2019 then the prob got solved by the microsoft had to even fight with Microsoft too on this issue as it's not the customer's mistake that they trusted amazon. I'm buying it from Amazon not from a lenovo outlet. This caused me lot of problems and tension as they give only 7 days time for return/replacement also. Very bad service by Amazon but that Amazon's leadership executive's service was amazing I gave her five stars. And the laptop is very very slow it hangs also be careful before buying it.

"
"

  Good laptop.Battery comes around 5hrs normal usage.Full charge from 10 to 100 takes around 2hrs.Performance is good.Looks premium.Boots very fast no lags.Overall good laptop.

"

  I bought this laptop for basic home tasks like Ms office, browsing and entertainment. Definitely no gaming purpose . So don't go for gaming although it has graphics AMD Radeon.Pros-1. Convenient keyboard. Love it.2. Dolby audio is superb.3. Usb 3.0 port4. 15.6 hd plus Good display5. Comes with pre installed ms office6. Light weight.7. Doesn't heat up excessively.8. Lenovo Vantage app is great.Cons-1. All usb ports are on left side as in photo but will do.2. Front cam is vga. Very poor quality3. Battery is inbuilt. Cannot detach without an expert4. Battery is average. Don't expect too long to last. Maximum 3-4hrs on continuous usage.5. Multi tasking is ok but not very good.It is a value for money laptop when bought in Great indian festival.

"
"

  Does all the jobs efficiently,  as expected, Win10 OS, Office packaged is very nicely.Go for it & unpack and start using, to do your daily routine workNice to have : RAM 8 GB, and SSD options

"
"

  The worst laptop I ever seen in life, waste of time and money.

"
"

  Good product according to this price range

"
"

  Sound quality is real bad.. the sound start distorting and buzzing while playing videos on youtube or scrolling through the window..

"
"

  It is good laptop but processor is bit slow. It's good for students but not for office going persons.

"
"

  Very slow. It a new laptop and mouse moves so slow looks like its not maintained ever. Win 10 is one of problem but config also a part of issue. Will never by lenovo again. Tip: go for laptop with SSD

"
"

  It was a gift to someone.  They loved it. Good product with OS And OFFICE

"
"

  I got this product 1 month ago. Packing and delivery was excellent. Laptop is still working amazing. I am using Microsoft teams on it and I have downloaded many apps on it. Preloaded office and widows 10 is makes it very efficient. At the starting the password is must according to the laptop and makes it very secure.battery lasts for 5hr. It gets fully charged in 2hr.Must take.

"
"

  From 4gb built in ram hardly 1 - 1.2 gb is free even when only single application is running. System hangs with continuous usage of 2hrs or if multiple applications are running. With additional 4gb ram laptop is working perfectly fine and response time is improved significantly. By getting additional ram for around 1.4k this laptop is still the best deal at 26k.

"
"

  In this laptop how to install Microsoft office

"
"

  Stopped working within 10 days. The lenovo service center in gurgaon is pathetic. Regretting the decision to buy this

"
"

  I bought it on 05 August 2020. After almost two  months of use no issue...very good for kids in school as a beginner platform. keyboard keys are good...looks are sleek...customer care is world class. Awesome product.

"
"

  Extremely slow and lags when you run teams on it

"
"

  Extremely slow machine. Bought it for my grade 3 daughter who runs only TEAMS on this laptop for online classes. It run slow, keeps hangin and takes almost 5-10 minutes to start up and/or start apps. Very disappointed.

"
"

  worst purchase ever. I am not happy with the product and Amazon's service .  I really don't wanna keep the product but as per policy i have to keep it. I don't think so that I'm gonna buy anything again from Amazon,  I'm really very disappointed. I really want that Amazon resolve my issue regarding this product.

"
"

  Firstly the product of Lenovo is not good at all as I purchased this item and it started getting switched off automatically charger is not working properly services of Lenovo is not good I will not recommend anyone to purchase this product

"
"

  Original price was 30k, in offer got for 23k. I was happy. But it has severe battery issues.  Please dont go for it if u are working professionals. I use it for 1 hr, the battery dropped from 100 to 50. In 2hrs battery is zero.

"
"

  Fairly decent laptop at affordable price for basic home / online education use. Has Windows 10 & MS Office 2019 basic versions bundled.Outer packaging was opened. Inner packaging of laptop box was intact.

"
"

  The product is very good. More than my expectations.But only one problem, there is no fingerprint sensor, they have shown that there is fingerprint sensor.

"
"

  Overall laptop is Superbbbb. Performance is good, very stylish. Worth for this price range.

"
"

  Hard drive  spoilt in one month. The lenovo service team is so useless they said they will change the drive but will not reinstall windows. That is customer headache.

"
"

  Good value for money. Ideal for work from home.

"
"

  Processor too slow!

"
"

  Superb laptop..

"
"

  Don't go for negative reviews , it's very nice for normal with daily use

"
"

  The system hangs in between. I feel the graphic interface needs to be better and it should not hang.

"
"

  Awesome laptop 👌👌👌

"

"

  I am using for the past 3 months. Now the M key is not working hence not able to use the system. I need guidance for warranty replacement / repair

"

  Quality of camera didn't meet the expectations but the other things are just awesome. If you don't need camera for professional purpose just go for it.

"
"

  The product came defective and I had to go through 20 days of mental harasssment to return the item at my own cost. Plz dont buy it from this seller.

"
"

  Good laptop in this price range

"
"

  I liked the light and slim look with large storage. I did not like the speed as it is very slow to start up.

"
"

  You have mentioned preinstalled Office home and student 2019. Why i am having only preinstalled Office 2016 in the laptop received?

"
"

  Slow. It takes forever to open.  So slow that I can take a nap inbetween opening 2 applications

"
"

  Laptop switches on automatically and today is the 10 th Day after calling customer care they claimed , it had 7 day replacement policy.

"
"

  Old product sold by rectifying.

"
"

  It's heating up really fast and it is bit slow. Especially during set up. Just started using it.

  I think it's ok ok in this price, but that's not support keyboard backlight and processor is not most powerful, we can't play Heavy games. But that supported fingerprint and I like it.

  Excellent product..best performance. Display quality is good.Its comes with 256Gb ssd so less time required to access. You can play games also in low setting... There is no lag. Best laptop in this budget.

"
"

  On 1st day it gets stuck on some pagesss.  Fan produce little sound but its ok.I have got it in 40k

  When video or audio runs on a laptop in between sound is breaking (Karrr...karrrr sound is coming ) and gives a very bad experience. Not good for a person who continues watching video or audio on Youtube or another medium on a laptop...I won't recommend this laptop.

  Brought in 29/sep on amazon sale at price of 23,000 . Laptop runs very smoothly but after dew days it starts freezing for hours and I can't do anything instead of long press power off . But I replaced it and same and new one is extremely  fast .Its been 1 week so I m sharing you my experience:Pros :1. Display is very good as it is full HD2. Runs smoothly without lagging in multitasking and casualGaming  , RHYZEN 3 3200U is better than 7th gen i3 .3. Comes with MS OFFICE 20194. Stylish DesignCons:1. Viewing angle is not that good .2. Below averge bettery life ( 4-5 hours on normal usage , 3 hours on gaming and heavy multitasking)Overall value for money laptop . I will update my review after one month of usage .

"
"

  I bought this for 22990 after discount in bbd ... at this price... this is the best product with pre installed Windows 10 and ms office 2019... It has office 365 which makes the excel learning easier... You need to activate ms office bcz you will get only the free trial and you can activate it without any cost. Ryzen 3 is better than i3 7th generation. As of now no issue speed is good... Multi tasking without any lagging. Thank you Amazon 😃

  Hi, used the product for 20 days by now.1. good display FHD.2. Ryzen 3 is best compared with i3.3. Windows 104. Smooth working for 4 gb ram but you have to increase it upto 12gb I guess.5. Nice texture6. Very good ventilation when compared with other laptop like hp.7. Thin8. Battery comes close to 4 hr when used for browsing or for videos I suggest use it in battery saver mode.9. Call (mail) customer service and update warranty for up to 1 year.10. Speakers are above average.11. Keys are very nice to work.12. Hinges are far better now, as it is a long one.13. I suggest to uninstall antivirus (Windows firewall is sufficient) and install chrome for smooth usage(stop that explorer).14. Night vision is good.I brought it for 22k !!! U may get surprised.So,.  5 🌟 rating.My opinion:- go for it, it doesn't disappoint you. I think this combination is good . so, it will definitely hit high from now in the market and I will update after some usage.Edit 1:- after 2 months1. I feel display is not great. As it is not IPS2. BATTERY should have been still better than this.3. Main point is it takes time, initially though , for Right click to work.4. AMD gives updates.Edit 2:- After using it for 8 months now.1.) Just increase RAM for better performance2.) Really better than all Intel i3 processor.3.) Don't use it for advanced gaming.JUST HIT LIKE buttonEdit 3:- After using it exactly 1.5 years.It updates regularly, but it irritates as it takes to update for hours, initially when I start it shows lenovo logo and then going screen completely blank.  It happened to me 2 times for hours. LENOVO PLEASE FIX IT.

  I am writing this review after 1 month of usage...excellent performance and whopping graphics (thanks to vega 3 graphics card) clear and crisp display with excellent color contrast more than enough sound quality due to dolby audio screen is also big unbeatable design and premium look enough storage (1TB) doesn't lag only battery backup is bit low but that is compensated by its affordable charger and fast charging support comes with several unique features and justify its price...window 10 comes out of the box..upgradable..all necessary things are providedonce you purchased this laptop I guarantee you don't regret.note: my review is for daily casual and college use not for hardcore gaming use.

  I got this at 25.5k seller said he wont reduce price but its a lie now its 24k after 2 weeks =(Anyways so i have used this for at least 2-3 weeks so i can comment on performance- Battery Life : Not very good but not bad. Lasts 3-6 hours depending on use. If you wanna do light programming and browsing you have around 4 hours . Light gaming and browsing/music gives 3.5 hours. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR HEAVY GAMING duh for that buy a gaming laptop/xbox or whatev else that is MEANT for gaming.-Free stuff : YOU DO GET MS 2019 (feb) now since you get feb you wont get those new logos but still all features are same. Mcaffee is free for 365 days too =)-you can do light stuff on it-Features that are available on high end laptops like bendable screen(180degrees) and sleek design , thin bezels ARE there. LOOKS GREAT-AMAZING SPEAKERS-POOR WEBCAMThats it :)if you get intel i3 model around 27k then buy that. If this is at 25k buy amd a9. I think you should go for amd a9 as if this is 20/20 then that is 19/20 (just comparing but ryzen 3 isnt 20/20)however for student needs this is perfect. IF YOU DONT DO PROGRAMING AND JUST NEED FOR browsing and making projects and play internet games buy hp chromebook at 24k which is having touch screen today.EDIT :- BATTERY LIFE BECOMES TERRIBLE AFTER 6 MONTHS. LASTS ONLY 2 HOURS TO 4 HOURS!!!!

"
"

  This is bogus product. I recommend please do not buy as it is not worthy of your hard earned money. I received it two days back , hardly any app installed , still very very slow with tendency to hang frequently. Ryzen processor sucks ! Terrible experience and I am contemplating to send the product back.

"

  I purchased the Ryzen 3 edition of this laptop.CPU performance wise it is very good for lightweight day to day work such as browsing, watching movies, some Excel and PowerPoint work etcI am using it Transcend 110S NVMe SSD and 8 GB Crucial DDR4 2400 RAM CT8G4SFS824A and performance is much better now.This laptop cannot use M.2 SATA SSD such as Western Digital Green or Blue M.2 SATA SSD. Only NVMe SSDs are compatible. You can install a NVMe SSD as an OS drive while still using the internal 1 TB HDD for storing files.The screen has moderate viewing angles but you can live with that.

  Microsoft office 2019 missing.

"
"

  I bought laptop at ₹23000.It was slow initially, boot up time was 2 minutes and it hanged while using even YouTube (it was expected) . In task manager (ctrl + shift + esc) , i saw that disc usage was very high so i upgraded the laptop with an pcie ssd (₹4800) and 4 gb ram (₹1650) . It is working fine now.

"
"

  Bought this laptop with high hopes but found out its too slow and piece of junk. Feels like I am using laptop which is 5 years old. Touchpad is worst and extremely worst in responding. Processor and GPU struggle to keep the speed up of the laptop. I have not used any heavy softwares or games untill now. My review is based upon the normal web browsing and watching netflix. Even with this kind of light load, this laptop performs worst and hangs continuously. Run away from this laptop and avoid wasting your money

"
"

  battery is not so good so i reduce 1 star.

"
"

  Recently I brought s145 ryzen 3 model and after that I faced lagging issue. But after that I upgrade the laptop by adding 8 GB ram and 240 GB nvme m2 ssd and now the laptop is running best very fast. Boot up time 5-6 Sec. Now my config is - 12 GB ram 240 GB ssd 1 tb hard disk . And after that the graphics memory is increase from 512 mb to 2 GB.If you invest more than 6-7k then the laptop performed superr.

"
"

  This laptop is worth for the price and competitive to Intel laptops. Price is less compared to Intel laptops. Performance is equivalent or better for this price. We can play some games as well using this laptop. Fully satisfied and go for it without much thinking if you are looking for good processor performance, good configuration, good battery backup for the lower price. You will not get disappointed with this. Go for it.

"
"

  Worst product, never buy this model. Or may be the seller sold me a faulty product. Don't know.Never expected this from Lenovo... Lenovo should replace my product with a new one! From day 1 the system hangs so much tried all hacks/tweaks customizations in windows 10 nothing worked !!! It's so pathetic product I can't believe. None of my PCs behaved so pathetically before this. Maybe the amd ryzen processor is of very poor quality. Total waste of money.....

"
"

  Honest review....I have ordered this laptop and i was very excited and happy that i got a budget friendly laptop in 24770 but when i recieved  this laptop i make account etc all after 4 days it starts lagging and display blinking...Over all marking 05/10Body looks 10/10Display 8/10Graphic card 5/10Please increase your budget and go for higher range....Thank you.....

"
"

  Keyboard is alright but number keys are not working and that is the reason I gave it 1 star.So please solve it.

"
"

  It's unfortunate I had to return this laptop cos it was slow and had been slightly damaged when shipping otherwise all the other features were good. I'm not too sure whether i3 7th gen would have made a difference or not but I think 8GB RAM was definitely needed for this to run smoothly. Best budget piece at 27500. If more RAM were given and priced at 30k, I'd have still bought it, cos it had a 15.6"" FHD Screen, 1TB HDD, MS Office 2019 & even remained cool. No overheating. The battery lasted for 5 Hours at least. If it comes back in stock, I'll buy it again!

"
"

  Design is nice , performance is laggy, go for i3 ,then this or Pentium, battery backup upto1:30 hour , display is nice but  viewing angles are too bad , doesn't respond in opening two applications in background as chrome or power point,Or perhaps I get a defective pieceAnd Amazon says saw to service centerAnd it's four day of use

"
"

  It's been nearly one month since I have purchased this item for my sister, for online classes , watching movies and normal uses, and it's working perfectly.The memory partition is average as there are no much divided space all  in one drive. however you will get the correct mentioned features on the product , and amazingly this item will support PUBG gaming that I saw on some other devices , however I have not tried yet. It have office software are all pre installed , need to activate those with key. overall if you are looking for a budget laptop with normal functions this is pretty good option

"
"

  Everything fine. Got Windows 10 (Full version), MS office Full version and Mcafee Antivirus 1 year. Coming laptop design is very cool and very smooth. But i found only one issue which is battery will dry fast i mean mostly will get 3 hours only.Any way very good laptop.

"
"

  Ordered the product on 18th may and the product got delivered on 26th may .. laptop is v fast in this price range.. i got it for Rs 26490..ryzen 3 processor is v fast compare to i3 7th gen ..battery is lil bit a disadvantage . 3-4 hrs backup depending upon usage . If u play games then only it will for 1 hrs 30 mins or so although this laptop is not for gaming but with vega graphics u can still play few games.. already used the laptop for a week . Booting time is s close to 16 -25 seconds which is v gud .i hv purchased it for some medium work .studying n excel work and light gaming and if want to do heavy work than upgrade ram and also ssd slot available. Display quality is v gud crisp n clear display . Overall the product meet the expection and thank you appario ..always go with u only in future .. till now no issues .. will update more abt the laptop after a month thank u

"
"

  Worst product ever dont buy even for free its super slow damn slow and once u ordered it from amazon then u cant even return it such that i personally recommend you to not buy this product most disappointing product i have ever ordered.

"
"

  Thrird class product....too slow to operate...like 1st generation computerPathetic service supportStop working just after 4 months from purchasingNo service support, instead of working on their manufacturing issue forcing on customer handling... struggling to get service support even part is under warrantyDon't purchase.....if still u want to have...do regular pray not to have any breakdown....and u should have lot of waiting time considering the speed

"
"

  When I swithched on the product double tap right click not working . went google and edited some registry settings then worked. system was sluggish . I added 8 GB extra RAM . Now system runs smoothly. It has 4 GB RAM inbuilt in motherboard and one empty ram slot. BUILD quality average but design eyecatching. keyboard does not feel premium in typing but okay for average user.

  I bought this for my 10 years old. For a starter who plans to use a laptop for browsing, attending online classes, playing not-so-heavy online games, basic documentation works (word, powerpoint, excel) - this is a good enough one.Pros: - Value for money laptop. - Comes with inbuilt Windows 10 and pre-installed MS Office packages. - Relatively thin and light weight. - Good key pad arrangement - Touch pad with in-built click buttons - Ryzen-3 processor, takes a minute or two for booting but this is expected as this does not come with SSD. - Haven't observed any heating issues so far even after a continuous use of 4-5 hours or gaming or video. - Came with 1 year warranty. There was a student offer - 3 years extended warranty + On-site service + Sony headphone with mic for Rs.1799. It's a very good deal. - Decent battery life of 3-4 hours of continuous use.Cons: - Screen resolution is not so great - Webcam quality is poor - In-built speaker quality is decent not loud enough. We are using it with a headphone. - Charger has a peculiar shape and design. - There a warranty date mismatch which was sorted out after talking to the customer care.Go for it, if you plan to buy this for kids or basic daily use.

  Quite a nice product for the budget! This is a review after 2 weeks of usage:Pros:1.ryzen 3 rocks ! It's amazing and faster than i3 and even i5.2.great for everyday usage and buissness ,as it have office 365 pre installed, you can claim em easily.3.build is good, and flexible.4.has a PCIe m.2 connector.5.can able to play counter strike in steam without lag.6.it has full HD display7.does not lagg offten even if I use heavy application.Cons :1.BATTERY! Battery charges quick as well as drys quick. 3 h of normal use like online class can empty your battery.2.color! I hate this all gold color3.no USB c portBut it's nice , go for this not for the i3 !Edit 1 : this product really sucks in battery life but it's quite and amazing in performance. No issues found.

  Edit:The difference in performance after adding and booting from SSD drive is phenomenal! It feels like a completely new (much slicker) laptop now!Although, I realised all too late that the SSD slot on the laptop supports NVME type SSD (and not SATA). Choose what you buy carefully.Original Review:I've had this laptop for 9 months now and can confidently say it's woefully underpowered. I knew even at the time of buying that 4GB ram might be too less and that was apparent on the day I powered the laptop on. Booting took ages and everything worked at grandma speed.I upgraded the ram to 12GB the first week of operation itself which helped quite a bit. However, I've struggled to get anything important done on this laptop in the last 9 months of owning it. I mostly use it to watch Netflix or maybe light surfing on chrome.Recently figured that the HDD itself is also a bottleneck, and have now had to order a additional SSD to run the OS in. Hopefully that will solve it for me.Verdict : buy only if you're comfortable upgrading the laptop on your own or have access to a cheap repair shop. Total cost for me - 25K (laptop) + 2.5K (8GB RAM) + 3.5K (250GB M2 SSD) which I think is still much cheaper than buying an equivalent laptop directly.

  I purchased this laptop for 24500 which is a total steal for this laptop. Ryzen 3 works fine, don't expect to run heavy applications or games on it. 4gig of Ram and 1Tb HDD is also great for the price. The screen is a total plus point, its an FHD screen, it's a VA panel I guess but for anyone, it's much much better than those 768p HD displays. It is sharp and great to look at. Not good with the viewing angles (obviously a VA panel), but it is good enough. The speaker is fine and the keyboard is also fine for me. The battery life also seems to be okay with about 3-4 hours of backup. Only get this laptop if you are a normal user that does browsing, watching movies and typing or for basic office use, do not expect more than that.What I would suggest is to increase the ram to 8 gigs and if you can, please replace the HDD with a 2.5 inch SSD. Just by doing these 2 things, it will run much more smoothly than you can even imagine.

  Overall an 'OKAY' laptop. Amazing looking laptop (doesn't mean it's an amazing laptop though). If you're getting it for 25k and below that, it's the best laptop one can own at that price range. For I had to pay a bit more(28k) as GST had increased at the time (19 June 2020). I bought this for college assignments (on social sciences). It was urgent for me to buy and the screen impressed me when I saw this laptop on videos. I had a lot of expection with the screen when it arrived but the Full HD, anti-glare technology screen is misleading; ""anti glare"" is just for the name's sake, yes it doesn't reflect so much of  light but it's definitely is not 'anti glare', it should have been named ""less glare"". Moreover, it's side angle view is quite annoying at times, esp. if there are many people in a room watching movie in it. However it's 15.6 inch display almost feels like a  standard desktop's screen and has a resolution better than that of hp and acer laptops of this price range. So if you are a student looking a laptop for basic college works at low buget then this is the one for you but only if you are not angry with China because yes it's made there. Haha. Happy shopping.

  My case warranty issue ...I contact Lenovo center . Lenovo update warranty of one year......second thing is it is very good machine ryzen processer is very good no lagging. And it motherboard board m.2 sloat available after installing pcie nvme ssd it's work like roket.

"

  The build quality is excellent and the keyboard as well. The battery life lasts around 5 to 6 hours. The audio is good and the display as well. It is fast and responsive. However, the track pad is awful and the camera color acurracy is non-existent and you can see marks on laptop created 👋. It can play games that are very light. overall it is a good product

"
"

  Received the product on time, within  3 days. The laptop looks premium. Even though it is plastic body, it looks like aluminum. The thin bezel screen gives a stylish and latest look for the laptop. The specs are good. As youtube reviews states, the RAM and hard disk can be upgraded, which is a great thing. Since the hard disk is empty and there aren't much programs, the laptop is fast as of now. MS office is provided. The sound on this laptop is good. Everything works fine. Happy with the product.

  I m so disappointed that I just requested for return. I already have a Lenovo laptop and this made me confident to go with this brand. About the product, installation instructions are smooth. Issue starts afterwards. First heartbreak you will find the performance. When you try to open web browser like app, it will open with so delay that you once think of, have I clicked the app or not. Even my daughter who has used mobiles and laptop wondered, such delay actually happens in now world. Coming to sound, it's average.Second most disappointment is with camera. Due to Covid19, she is having virtual class and when she attended first session from this laptop, it was quite dark. She switched to my laptop again, to resume her class. With such configurations, I was really expecting that it will stand good for my kids requirement. Either I mistakenly got bad laptop or my choice is not good. Let's see, when this laptop gets replaced, it will change for better or not... Not expected for Lenovo...  :(

  Bought it for 27,990/- so reveiw is basis this price amount.Good slim machine.Value for money - No.Should be good in 22-24k price range.Slow processing on everything.Brand New machine takes over 6 minutes to start. (Strange).Hinges of screen looks very flimsy, so not sure how long it will last.Screen brightness low.Brand new Battery giving max 2.5 hours

  I had purchased this product on June 09, 2020. At the time of purchase, it was clearly represented on the website as under:·  Processor: AMD Ryzen 3 3200U processor, 2.6 Ghz base speed, 3.5 Ghz max speed, 2 cores, 4 Mb Cache·  Operating System: Pre-loaded Windows 10 Home with lifetime validity·  Display: 15.6-inch screen with (1920X1080) full HD display | Anti Glare technology·  Memory and Storage: 4 GB RAM | Storage 1 TB HDD·  Design and battery: Thin and light Laptop| 180 Degree Hinge| Laptop weight 1.85kg | Battery Life: Upto 5.5 hours as per MobileMark·  This genuine Lenovo Laptop comes with 1 year onsite domestic warranty from Lenovo covering manufacturing defects and not covering physical damage. For more details, see Warranty section·  Inside the box: Laptop, Charger, User Manual | With Microsoft Office 2019·  Ports and Optical Drive: 1 HDMI, 2 USB 3.0, USB 2.0 |4-in-1 card reader (SD,SDHC,SDXC,MMC)| Combo audio and microphone jack | No Optical DriveI had purchased the said product for my daughter considering that all the schools had to operate online due to Covid 2019 pandemic. However, since day one i.e. June 09, 2020 the said product did not perform as required and we faced speed issue on number of occasions. It takes ample of time for any application to open. Due to these issues, my daughter was unable to concentrate in her studies and her performance was badly affected. She is mentally disturbed because of very slow performance of the said product.In the month of December 2020, I had called the customer care and I was informed to set-up the Lenovo diagnostic tool and scan the laptop on regular basis. I followed the instructions provided to me, however, the problem could not be fixed and my daughter continued to suffer hardships and mental harassment.Recently, I once again called the customer care and was forced to lodge a complaint on March 04, 2021. On a lot of back and forth with the customer care, I was informed that the said product will perform slow on Windows 10 and that I should use Windows 08 for the said product to perform properly. I was shocked and surprised with this information considering the fact that representation to purchase the said product on Amazon website in June 2020 was specifically with Windows 10 preloaded in the said product for Home Edition.When I told them to replace, they denied.

  After a 6 month use,  we just can't find any problems. Well this proves to be the best choice at this range in spite of not having a fingerprint sensor and USB type C port. Below are the reasons :1. Comes With MS OfficeYou might see reviews starting they didn't receive the office package. That isn't true. Sometimes they wouldn't have found where it is.2. Super upgradable(if wanted for heavy tasks)You can expand its RAM up to a massive 20 GB and it has an additional M.2 NvMe SSD port. That's a boon.3. Immersive audio experienceDolby does makes the audio much better.4. Lenovo online SupportWell driver downloading isn't a problem now. The website detects your system and does it automatically (drivers excluded in Windows updates)5. Light GamingNot much I can ensure but you can play games like ones of Assassins creed family,most racing games and other stuffs in medium graphics.Rest you can find in the other reviews as well. So just didn't mention.The only con is the battery life.Standard - 5 hoursMulti tasking  - 4 and half hourGaming or other heavy tasks  - 3 hours.(avg. Depends on the games)Still it isn't that big con.That's all guys

"

  It's been a month since purchase I want to share my personal reviewThis laptop is definitely a good choice only if you are here for study purpose and light game like gta SA ,vice city etc but when it comes to heavy gaming like valorant,gta V and similar this laptop isn't a good choice.This laptop have 512 MB of vram so you guys already know what you can do in this.Battery backupBattery backup for this laptop is lowest it shows it will work for 3 hrs but even if I leave it at standby without any process it hardly last for 1.5-2 hrs so poor battery backup.Ram4gb ram isn't enough for your processes even many a times my Microsoft office hangs so make sure you attach a good ram after purchase preferably a 8gb.Touchpad and KeyboardTouchpad is cool and sleak designed it's too good but inbuilt buttons are there so be gentle to it and keyboard keys are also soft and handy must say.Complimentary:-You will get a Microsoft ofgice 2019 student edition for lifetime more than sufficient even for many office works.And you get mc afee antivirus one year subscription free as well though mc afee isn't the best antivirus out there but it will help.Both are pre installed and for activation you just need to open and login to both.SoftwareSoftware is very good but again it's because ram that the software isn't that much effective.ProsLow price,ms office lifetime,mcafee one year,amd ryzen 3 and vega 3 integrated mobile graphics,180° rotate.ConsBattery,laggy,low gaming.

  Great for daily home use. Mine came with 4GB of memory, which is bare-minimum now to support modern web browsing. Google’s Chrome browser consumes a lot of memory, so go for 8GB if you have the option. The CPU seems speedy enough. My one honest annoyance is that, like many laptops, the screen tint appears slightly more bluish—white skews slightly blue. I didn’t see this on my old MacBook Pro, so it may just be a Windows issue with the available color profiles. I mentioned home use, because the top of the lid scratches easily, so taking this on the road would likely induce scratching from rough handling. The thing which I didn't like at all is the battery life, Its battery life is very low i.e. after full charging it survives only for 2-2.5 hrs with continuous use. I think its high time Lenovo should really focus on this particular thing.

"

  Warning* these are all faulty and refurbished products by Lenovo. Had my own tech guy check it out and it's obvious that they are all old faulty products, refurbished and sent to customer with the hoax of an ""offer price"". Lenovo is known for this, and it shows when you try to reach out to them for a replacement, they say the invoice is more than a week old and cannot be replaced even though the warranty is a year. Multiple emails and DM's later, they still won't respond for a replacement. The laptop hangs and freezes everytime as users have mentioned here. It doesn't want to connect to a WiFi connection and you always need to disable the adaptor every now and then. My suggestion, go for a Parle G laptop or a chor baazaar laptop, but stay away from Lenovo. I would even suggest Dell, but never Lenovo just for the fact that you would be paying full price for faulty and old products. Amazon is also part to blame for having such sellers who won't even bother to help customers once payment is done.

  On first day motherboard crashed totally lost joy of new laptop bt thanks to lenovo they replace motherboard . Think before buy this product. If this issue happen after a year nearly it cost 17000 rs . (Feels like refurnish product from amazon ) otherwise ok ok motherboard issue

"
"

  Description mentions Windows 10..turns out to be Windows 10 SL. Description also mentions MS Office. Turns out same is Home and Student edition. Would appreciate if correct info is shared. Other than this, product appears to be as desired and delivery was timely. Can comment more only after usage.

"

  Got my laptop worst experience with that within a week. Laptop is slow and freezes continouslyWill take long time to get Into laptop and I wonder how can people try to work from home with this type of laptop. Disappointed totally.And  also the display is dull.Coming to looks it’s pretty goodAlso it is asking for the license for MS OFFICE products,. Disk will always be full with very low performance..

"

  I bought this laptop since my son needed one for his online classes.Got this Laptop delivered on June 22nd , setting up took 2-3 hours , but then the issues started. The laptop is extremely slow , launching a word doc takes 3-5 minutes . Logging into  MS Teams takes forever , failed to even suit the purpose it was bought for . My 9 year old ACER works much faster than this one.Logged a complaint with Amazon and the technical support person was good , but the issue still remains the same.Now waiting for the technical support person to visit physically and check the laptop . But seriously I would want  to return this and go for something better like HP or Dell.A mistake that I am regretting now.

"
"

  I'm not a heavy user, I need a laptop to serve the internet, occasionally watch some videos and prepare my presentations and Lenovo Ideapad S145 perfectly suit my needs. The best budget laptop that I ever owned (got Dell i3 laptop before). Ryzen 3 is much better than i3. Windows 10 home and ms office lifetime pre installed is additional plus point.

"
"

  This is good laptop for office/daily use.For programming- there is a slowness with eclipse IDE & other dB connections but still works pretty well.Battery life is average for continues Netflix & online streaming (2-3 hrs). Apart from that battery life is good, close to 5-6 hours.Built quality is average, I personally would have liked more improvement in built quality.You get MS office suite 2019 & antivirus (1 year) with this laptop.This is not at all a gaming laptop.  The ryzon 3 processors & intel i3 6th gen are somewhere equal at performance barrier.  For the range of 25k-30k I found this is currently best laptop.Note: I wanted to use ryzon processor over intel.

"
"

  I'm writing this review after 5 months of usage. I'm completely disappointed with the performance of the laptop. I don't use it for gaming or any excessive work. I use it for regular purpose and for a basic excel work. It is taking unusual time to ON and to open any app. Intel  Low processor Laptops are better than AMD ryzen 3 laptops. Please go with I3 if you are planning for ryzen 3. You feel bad for the performance after purchase. Don't do a mistake like me.

"
"

  The product is very poor . it's laggy and also hangs alot . And here's the bonus the battery is extremely poor . It says 5.5 hrs battery life but last only 1:30 to 2 hrs max . And the office well it only shows due to network problem we are have issues to activate and the wifi too u connect automatically doesn't work u always need to go n hit the connect again n again .Refund is impossible so incase if u bought also n want to return well that's impossible u will directed to page where an expert will talk to you . I also tried to talk and I waited 30 mins and atlast the call got automatically disconnected.Overall the laptop is very very very bad .and it have stupid place for touchpad . U are going to suffer to much if u buy it like I am .

"
"

  After 6 Months of usage :It is good for people who uses light applications like microsoft office, photo editing but its not for gaming , multitasking and video editing.Battery lasts for 2 hours for continuos working.Webcam is Ok for zoom callsTrackpad is smoothly workingKeyboard is not much good.Sound Quality is good.Viewing angles of display are not good.Hinges loses after 3 months.

"
"

  Software got corrupted after 7 months of use, but can understand that . However the real pain is getting their service centre guys to understand the problem. Different people gives different diagnostics and issue resolution tips. Nothing works. Finally they said they are not responsible for OS and reach out to Microsoft, that too under warranty.which I feel was a compleletely irresponsible way of dealing with a customer. So if you are a techie and can service your own laptops, go for it. If not pls don't. I had to shell out money from my pocket, when the product was still under warranty.

"
"

  Horrible product not at all suitable for online classes in the middle of the class the screen is filled with colourful lines and then goes fully blackAnd the battery life doesn't even last for an hourA total waste of money

"
"

  Very Good product at this price range. I bought it for 27k.Good PerformanceSpeed as mentioned is getting above 2GHzAnti glare screen is perfect unless it is very bright light on background.Don't go for other AMD models.At this price range AMD Ryzen is providing much better performance even morethan i3.Battery life is bit low Around 3 to 3 1/2 hrs.Those who are looking for basic model laptop go for it.This product will exceed you expectations for sure.

"
"

  I bought this in January 2020 before Pandemic.  It is unbelievable, there are many defects with the basic design. when it is folded, the screen is touching the keypad and the impressions are now on the screen, just after 6 months of use.  one side of the outer margin of the screen is not properly resting while closing.  To add all to this, the system is very slow right from the beginning.  I am using programs like MS office but still, it is taking time just to open programs like MS Word.  should check if this has a warranty... I do not recommend this.

"
"

  I brought this product with pre-installed Windows . After one month of use laptop got very slow. Without running any app, you can see memory and disk are running with 100% capacity. I reached out to Lenovo customer service and they told that to run the Windows 10 I should upgrade the RAM of this product to 8GB(minimum).

"
"

  Let's keep it short.First of all please update the windows 10 version to 1909. My laptop stopped working from second day. After updating its working fine.Perfect for watching YouTube video, MS Office work, running basic photo editing software like Photoshop. But please do not try to play games or install video editing software. It might crash. So in short, only for BASIC work.

"
"

  I'm disappointed with battery. Yesterday only I recieved. It was taking 2 hrs and 20 minutes but backup is just 4 hrs. And I'm installed euro truck simulator 2 game , when it is running I found soo many lags. I like the design and it looks. Display also very nice. Over all it's a best laptop in 28k.

"
"

  The product is sound with good asthetics. The processor under perform with the OS. Its painfully slow. It works all good apart from that but the processor is slow as it can be for a modern PC for its price. You are better off with another higher processor for this model. Dont just look at the design look for better processor but not this one. Invest a little more and you will be happy. I regret purchasing just for the speed of the PC.

"
"

  Not so happy, I thought AMD  processor is more powerful than i3.But after buying it, I am not happy with the speed of AMD. Very very slow processor!Battery life poor,if open more than one task it hangs.Even restart is not working.You have press the power button for few seconds.

"
"

  The features are ok i purchases it on dec 2019  today being 4 dec 2020,thought if giving a review though i just use this laptop for mails basically workpurpose so from my point of view there is lagg while starting / the mousepad alreading begin to freeze / the page flikkers ,i mean i do not use the laptop like a hardcore even just for office mails ,forget gaming or anything else just basic

"
"

  Good configuration at this price under 25K. Low battery backup. Very slow. But after I upgraded storage by adding M2. NVME SSD 250 GB and installing Windows 10 on it the system runs very fast. Also, added one 8 gb DDR4 ram in the free RAM slot. Screen FHD display is preety good. Overall value for money is great considering they also pre-installed MS office 2019 Home and Student for life time and MS Windows 10 Home Single Language.

"
"

  osm laptop very good brand i always lenovo lapotp because it is available very cheap price with high confrigration and i must recommended this laptop beacuse i cheak this confrigration i other brands but there charge is too high with this same specification .amd processor is very fast and cheaper price comparison to intel .and this price segment osm price provide by lenovo .

"
"

  The product hangs like anything. Use Microsoft Office, browse the web, trying watching something online, trying doing some basic work stuff, there is nothing the machine does smoothly.Its the worst choice ever you could make for a laptop.No value for money

"
"

  Poor battery life, just got it and in 6 months battery is dead. Screen blacks out often while working, System hangs frequently, Can't work on more than two programs, system slows down, laptop gets heated very quick. Service not good for Lenova. Local service don't respond to the issue and ask the customer to register a complaint with Lenova customer care whatsapp number and there is only automated response and no response to the issue.

"
"

  It's a good laptop for normal usage. If you facing problem (slow performance) than uninstall the antivirus (macfee live safe). You will see a great change in performance.

"
"

  If u r looking for a better smooth PC Chromebook then I would recommend you to go for atleast Rs +40k. Screen is not so good , working a little bit laggy , speed is not so fast , I would not recommend this for any gaming or official works , etc. But it's good for net surfing that's all.

"
"

  The laptop is sooooo slow that it cannot do even basic operations. It takes 5-10 mins to start and takes another 10 mins to open microsoft word or excel. Basic text writing or basic excel operations like addition are enough to hang the system. Lenovo has not been responding for past several months. We need to buy another one since this one is just a useless box. Amazon please help in getting support from Lenovo.

"
"

  The laptop had glitches ever since i got it. It is very slow and keeps lagging.It has been just 3 months since i got it and some keys are not working even though I have handled the laptop with care.

"
"

  I ve never used AMD Ryzen 3 or any processor from that brand. This computer is super slow, slower than intel pentium gold. I ve been using the Ms office and all, usually opeining documentary files. If you open 5-6 tabs on google chrome, it hangs. Is it any defect? Should I return the product?

"
"

  I am using this laptop for 6 months now. Product was received in best condition. I had to use it majorly for Excel and Word file operation. It takes a bit longer to start as compared to other brands, maybe coz of Rayzen processor. Otherwise there are no complaints till date. Processor is bit slow as compared to Intel.

"
"

  This is a very useless product don't buy it, and there is only a replacement policy & no refund. The PC freezes for a long time after every 15-20minutes also the trackpad keeps locking on its own. Doesn't match 4gb ram by any chance. I'd suggest you to buy a different product but not this one. It's been giving me problems from the very 1st day like going blank & freezing or hanging.

"
"

  Nice product by Lenovo. Windows 10 +MS Office.Ryzen CPU system, all going well But absence of DVD system merely con property.

"
"

  The product was initially freezing a bit but after I installed another 8 GB of RAM, it's super smooth. I found out the culprit was the intregated graphics which uses a lot of RAM. Infact after I installed 8 gb and when my total ram became 12 gb, only 9.32 gb was available for use. Test was used by system resources.

"
"

  It is value for money but battery has an issue to give you around 2 to 3 hrs with continues work and face some minor lag issue which is negotiable I thought !After all this laptop is best for students who make PPT or word documentation....Thanks,Lenovo & unbox Therapy  From  Rohit

"
"

  Laptop is slowit maybe the 4gb ram bottle neck.Rest all is goodthe chrger have high width in its plug which causes a little discomfort

"
"

  Don't buy this product. The processor is very slow. Even simple apps like windows take at least 2-4 minutes to open. Jumping from window to window is a nightmare.  The technical team is very bad. They put you hold for 30 mins at a stretch and even after that it gets disconnected. No call backs.

"
"

  Over all very good.Only 1 issue I found unacceptable is poor battery backup. Lasts no more than 2-3 hrs

"
"

  Very slow in processing for applications.Worked properly for 10days. Later on.. it started suffering me.I am facing the worst experience. I am using dual core processor which pc, which is 13year old. It is better than this laptop.

"
"

  Almost 1 year I am using it.Seems it has a 2 bit processor. Now I am working on it, and theBrowser has not opened in last 15 min. God knows what's happening.It's like that from the beginning. Too slow. TOO SLOW.Pathetic. Oh god! Why companies are manufacturing thes things.

"
"

  Ideal for light users. Do not very much expectation such as budget laptop. Not bad purely value for the money.

"
"

  Very worst laptop pls don't buy . for normal use also this pc can't able to sustain. hanging while opening Excel and all the application.and after 1 year this is suddenly can't able to on the pc.

"
"

  It hangs all the time I don't know if this problem occurs only in my unit but battery life is also very poor . The claimed 4-5 hours of continuous battery life is a fuke .In all a very bad experience.

"
"

  The product is very good. Lot of things bundled in this thin and lightweight package. The body is of average material. Ethernet port should be there for better connectivity. Camera is very poor. Processor is bit slow when compared with i5,7th gen.

"
"

  The product is having many issues, Microsoft Office is not activated. Microphone jack is not working.  Amazon has not even sent an invoice for the purchase.  They had said one year onsite warranty but they have not given any details.  I  am not able to contact Amazon or lenovo.  I feel like the computer is a waste of money.

"
"

  If you want a good battery and good sound please don't purchase it, worst battery life and sound is very very low, design is good working good after update camera is 0.3 MP don't even want to talk about it if you have some more budget please go with HP or Asus Vivo book.

"
"

  I have purchased the product on 28 feb and when scanned warranty qr it says it has started on 20th dec 2019. What is going in is it used product and what about office which us mentioned in description ?

"
"

  Good laptop, i have purchase in only Rs.24000Rayzen is better than i3 processor.But in windows 10 os Speed slower than windows7 osIf we install windows 7 in this laptop then drive note support to this laptop.

  Its not worth anything my desktop is faster in processing then this product its hanging alot too much not wrth anything

  It's good I am using from past 5 hours...It's working good ...I will provide the more updates later...

  I have purchased it from acer website.It is 30000 there.U can purchase it. The item will come from blue dart within 10 days. I got I a week.Good laptop

"
"

  I bought a new Acer Aspire 3 just 2 days back from Amazon and it's not working properly System hangs while using. It's hangs while opening tabs. Takes more than 1-2 mins to open. This is my new laptop with my first salary and it is showing lots of defects.

"
"

  Laptop was good for only one month. One day it gets dead and not switching on and taking power.Cannot return..Amazon not taking it back...as return period is over..Totally disappointed from amazon. They should have provided technical assistance for repair. Telling me to contact seller.

"
"

  Very upset with the Amazon replacement policy... The technician will come and then check and then recommend for a replacement.  So why to buy from Amazon better to buy from a Retail shopThe model I purchased yesterday with screen going blank after 30 min.... Also after 24hrs the web cam is showing dark images even after adjusting with Manual or auto mode.....

"
"

  This laptop comes with WIN 10, 4GB DDR 4GB RAM.This is absolutely a nonsense. It cannot run more than one app at a time. Even google chrome freezes and takes ages to access any app. After windows Update the laptop stopped working.

"
"

  The 4 GB RAM is just insufficient , guys please do not buy this , simple chrome and firebox , YouTube takes 80 percentage of your ram , just uselessGuys please please don't buy this laptop , it's jist 4 GB of ram and acer has done a bad job of optimizing stuff.. doesn't work at all. It's just stuck all the time..useless.Am writing this after using for a month .simple pathetic

"
"

  All technical sides are worth money. Processor is quite slow though. I have bought recently & almost no softwares expect Office programs. It takes time while opening them. Its light and very stylish. While buying I opted for Office programmes and other installments (cause I dont know how to use Win 10). Other thing is its genuine product so it comes with Microsoft office 365 1 month free trial. After that if you dont buy full version trial version ends nd you cant use any of them. No DvD reader and no SD card reader. Technology is going advanced so old models have it this one does not.Budget friendly good laptop for students or office if you are not planning to do anything extra on it. For games or graphic softwares go for other models.

"
"

  In two days of purchasing this type of screen show many time.... hanging problem occur continuously .even I complain to Amazon customer care till the time complaint not attend....I want to replaced my laptop

"
"

  Very slow laptop, processor and RAM Are not up to mark  feels like using very old pc. My calculator works fast than this  , response time is very slow , display is average  battery is average, thinking of returning the product in just first 2 hrs of use

"
"

  I needed a laptop on an urgent basis so bought this but the System crashes all the time. Screen freezes too. My 5 yr old laptop works better than this one. Amazon has booked a technician's visit, I hope i do get a replacement or refund.

  Very nice Product and slimIt is very nice

"

  Pathetic product. With Just MS Word open, no other app open, system starts hangs and  Memory usage reaches 92% and you won't be able to open any other application like Web Browser.Battery life mentioned is 9.5hrs but with just one application open its not giving 3hrs.When you raise a complaint to return the product they will simply refuse. They write ""Replacement within 7days"" but in that case also they will make you call Manufacturer, with no final result, you have to keep same product and keep following up with Customer care.Even if you want to go for higher version of Laptop like i5 or AMD , they will not allowed.I am 5+year old active customer with frequent buying behavior  and very low return rate, still they are not ready to support.As they have started fraudulent activity by selling product with wrong product description, it better to refrain yourself from buying on site, especially when it marked as ""replacement only"" as in this case they sell wrong products.

  Extremely Slow this garbage laptop,,  i want sell ,, prize start with 1 Rs, tatti laptop.30 minute take to start .Tatti laptop, I bought on 17 august 2020, but the issue is that the display of the laptop is "" yellow tint"".  which takes away the quality of natural pictures , all colors looks dull and dirty , find audio problems and HD quality is also not impressive. its to slow ,click wait and watch small circle..anybody facing same display ( colors ) issue ? pls check and confirm or any setting required ? I did all.I will update review and star if my issue resolve.

"
"

  Good product below 40000 ruppees. But processor speed is slow than information provided.

"
"

  This laptop is totally waste of money, I took it 2 months for my children for online classes, it is very slow, it will take hell lot of time to switch tabs in Chrome/Mozilla or any Brower, Webcam will not work properly most of the times, it shows black. I have updated the windows time to time, but not much of use. we took to it for browsing but it is not at all suitable for anything. This product it not at all recommended. I am totally disappointed with ACER, I am planning to sell it and buying a new one.

"
"

  Look - goodThickness - goodProcessor - SUCKSIt looks like I have using older version of pentium processor packed in latest version of laptop.I ve been using i3 since long time as I don't want much from my laptop...I am just interested in watching movies and browsing simple stuff...but doing this in this acer laptop looks very sloppy.I am very unhappy with the speed....and especially at this price...just don't go with it.It takes minutes for programs to open and that too I have not yet installed any new apps ..I can't even imagine what if I install some few basic apps.I would not recommend this laptop.

"

  Laptop bag not received

"
"

  This is my second acer laptop. Elegant fast and sturdy device. FullHD antiglare display, light weight, Good product. Upgrading the Ram to 8gb is suggested. Other than that no complaints. Fast delivery. Thank u amazon.

"
"

  This is my fifth Acer. On second day my screen went blank. I researched on net and realized problem is with Windows 10 and its updates. I reloaded windows 10 ,stopped automatic updates, reduced startup programs to minimum and started using Micro soft Edge as browser. All problems vanished.  Some problems exists while using chrome.Only negative aspect is battery life is 3.5 hours. I am totally satisfied with my Acer and it is value for money as I got it in festival sale of Amazon.

"
"

  This Laptop's other features are ok  . but its webcam is not HD quality therefore the  image captured  is very dark and blurred even in  ample light.  It can not be used for vedio calling or online meetings!!!

"
"

  Laptop look's good smooth design and I say this laptop is  very good for the office use and vedio edit etc ,  to here every features like display,sound, browsing speed, battery(3-4hr continue watching movies)  are awesome for small budget and I have truly satisfied for purchasing the laptop of price 31990 thank you Amazon,so I face  hang problem if you can open multiple window .....😅😅😅😛

"
"

  The Brand New Laptop delivered had crashed just 1 week after starting.Tried Contacting Acer India/BLR service center but the response was v.poor & finally someone answered the call & diagnosed that HARD DISK needs replacement!! They had taken the faulty Laptop without any Receipt & till date there is no replacement or news on  Delivery.VERY POOR PRODUCT & SERVICE QUALITY

"
"

  Pathetic, it's not charging from day 1. Initially I tried quite many times and it started charging then I thought it's fine...and I cancelled replacement request but in just 10 days it stopped charging...now totally dead.

"
"

  System works very slow.I have not added any other program to it even then starting Chrome takes a lot of time forget opening next App everything freezes.No dedicated  power button but is provided on keyboard

"
"

  This is really a horrible product. Dont buy it. Even though the specs are good, the laptop hangs like a dog. Every application you open it hangs for 1-2 mins. Piece of useless stuff. I have written to the Vendor, but no response.

"
"

  After some days the adaptor of laptop stop working , call doesn't connect to customer care easily , somehow i managed to complaint , more than 10 days has been passed nobody came for solution till now , as customer care said our technician will visit you.....still waiting..... worst service and product for me....need them to improve their customer service

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  Very very poor quality product from acer. Surprisingly they make this poor quality laptop and when they broke while handling, they deny covering this in warranty.Worst experience with ACER. Poor quality and poorest service.

"
"

  Very bad choice. Repent my decision. Bought on 8 th August . Within month started giving windows repair issue. Service center told mother board needs to replaced. But no spare available in warehouse india. Hardly used for 10 days . No proper customer service. They shipped faulty new laptop. The laptop is still with service center and they don't have answer when they repair it.Think before buying.

"
"

  MS Office was promotional for a week. Battery back up not more than 4 hrs. Amazon platform is more costly than its own site cost. I believed on Amazon for better cost. Its available on its site  at 30K.

"
"

  Please please Don't buy this, it's too slow and hungs up. it's only for browsing and not for another usage not even some photo editing.It looks good, design is cool but the inner side is worse and the battery stays for 4-5 hrs only. If you want to upgrade Ram u have to open up the back panel which is against warranty policies.You really can't use it without Ram upgraded which may cost u an extra 4K.

"
"

  It's an awesome laptop.. Just one thing that It says pre installed microsoft.. But for all usage of apps like office excel it asks for PRODUCT KEY.. Suggestion a support call from either Acer or Microsoft should be must after delivery so that ppl who don't know how to start with the set up, can do this.. Still finding trou contacting on call to both Acer and Microsoft.. Nd that's terrible

"
"

  Such a slow processor can't Evn open chrome with 4Gb RAM, LCD display is the worst one, Camera dead cheap... instead I suggest buy different with high gb ram, and also NO Microsoft software inbuildSuggest NOT TO BUY THISI suggest i5, 8Gb 10gen in any different brand#experience for getting it

"
"

  Hi, The product purchased is very slow and the processing system is lagging extremely behind. The product is not reaching the expectation, the working is slow and it makes the whole profuct slow. Basic software performances take huge amount of time to respind and work. Wishing to return the product as soon as possible. Kindly help for the same.

"
"

  Experience is horrible. Net surfing is dead slow. Google chrome or any other search engine does not open up at all or takes long to open. Online meeting website like Microsoft Teams or Zoom app is non-responsive or takes long to response. Download speed of any file, even non-bulky file is dead slow. Don't buy this product.

"
"

  Worst purchasr i have ever done. From the first day the camera was not working properly.  It was  suddenly gets off during VC. Panel is very poor, bad resolution. And today suddenly a noice came out of the hard disk while using the laptop. I have immediatly shut down the system. I want immediate replacement of the product.

"
"

  Really liked the product, bought it for my friend and he is happy. Thank u Amazon

"
"

  I had been using HP Compaq laptop for last more than ten years ,first time purchased this acer aspire , and now realise that I have made a big mistake by purchasing this laptop. Gets hanged frequently and starts very slow. This is zero before HP Compaq laptop. Want to return itnow

"
"

  Battery with internet hardly 2.5 hrAnd camera is 0.3 mp so not goodAnd build quality good but don't have keyboard Back light and slow processing.If u add ssd then it will be speed up.Overall point 1. Less price  2.good display  3. Good for student

"
"

  Satisfied with purchase. Got it for rs 34999/-. Value for money

"
"

  battery isn't strong.. description is wrong..there is no backlight for keyboard..

"
"

  Performance of this laptop is just horrible. It takes lot of time to boot and reboot.It takes hell lot of time to open simple office apps like word and excel even internet explorer.

"
"

  Worst product and performance is very slow. System is responding very slow. Every application is taking more time to open and struck the application frequently and crashes the application.

"
"

  मेरा लैपटॉप खराब हो गया ना तो अपने replace किया और ना हीअब service center par बिना parts import के कारण ठीक किया जा रहा है।लैपटॉप लेने के 10 दिनों बाद खराब हो गया 1sep. को service center par दिया था पर आज 26sep. तक ठीक कर के रिटर्न नहीं किया है।ये आपकी service है?

"
"

  I dont like the product at all.. it gives 0 performance. It does not have the speed of a 2 gb ram computer.. pathetic.. and customer service just keep on putting your call on hold.

"
"

  Do not support any app properly it hangs again and again. I think this laptop is not good quality create new problem again and again. Pease check first how to solve coming problem after return period and then purchase. Faultly product sold to me.

"
"

  This is worst of money.Taking time to open more than one sleep time.Camera not working properlyWorst money in this price

"
"

  Ok

"
"

  The laptop is good and sleek but a Ram upgrade is mandatory for smooth experience. Only issue I'm facing is the webcam often goes black in between a call. I have raised a compliant to acer hopefully it'll get resolved. I will update once I have one.

"
"

  full like no dislike

"
"

  best laptop in this price .......very fast .....you can go for this .....

"
"

  Suddenly laptop camera becoming black back round and taking too much time while opening file... After upgrading RAM little better.. If you want to do multiple tasks at once then don't go with this configuration.

"
"

  Within one week display gone unserviceable after 2 days still system  fails to start  due non availability of items system at service centre. Requirest to change the product ......

"

"
"

  Dear Customers,Please don't buy Acer laptops.. the performance of this laptop is so worst and slow. And the second thing is it getting slower with the windows 10. I give 0 ratings to this laptop.

"
"

  Very slow . And installment service also poor.  Though the service guy was decent and polite.

"
"

  Yes , it's a good product for the price, value for money just wait for some special offers I bought it for 32,999/-, once check before buying. Overall it's good b, just ts bit slow processing but upto to the expectations.

"
"

  Guys Don't buy it I am having many issue with in 4 months it's just working so slow not having long battery lifeI am irritated after buying this all the reviews by company is wrong 😡

"
"

"
"

"
"

  Laptop not working, packing looks like a new products but I got toy laptop only its like a dummy

"
"

  NOT RECOMMENDED! Recieved with a scratch. 4GB Ram is way too slow to work with. Still Ms Office can run decent. Can't guarantee about the other apps.

"
"

  Freezes in between which is very irritating. Also only Microsoft Windows is bunddled with it instead should have bunddled office .

"
"

  I am a programmer and not suggest to buy this laptop even for general purpose....Other companies laptops have better performance compare to this...!

"
"

   Please don't buy this laptop. The screen keeps freezing. I bought this laptop for my daughters online classes but every 15-20mins whether using zoom or Microsoft teams it keeps freezing. Processor is too slow.  Was coming back to HP brand after a gap of 10 years but this has reminded me that why I stayed away all these years. Please do not waste your hard earned money on this.

"
"

  This is  a review after more than 6 months of usage.I had an azuz laptop. But since I had many problems while operating it I ordered this one. At first it was good But now it keeps switching off at times. At first had 9 hR battery now only 3-4 hrs. Not happy with the purchase.

"
"

  Looks good 🙂😊

"
"

  At this prize laptop looks premium. Amazing Design, I got latop with in 3 days  today. I will edit my comment After a week, when I will observe all its functions deeply. It has Magnificent Processor... Amazing Display.. Easy to use.  Battery is also Good. Smooth Touch pad. Overall a genniune Product for Educational and Business Purpose. Go for It.Minnor Issue:- It's making some noise while running over internet.

"
"

  Pros:Display quality.Light weight.Decent sound.Good performance as per it's hardware.Cons:One main thing is it's GPU is shared memory not dedicated. Almost  2GB ram will allocated for Graphics. Felt like 4gb even it's 5.9gb usable.Design flaws are there, rough edges like unfinished .Heat vent is placed at bottom, so we have to keep alway on flat surface.Very thin bezel around display.

"
"

  laptop is hanging if we install more products

"
"

  I bought recently and was not disappointed with the product at all. However if you are looking for a product that supports accounting software, etc, please buy a bit higher range. Laptop is more or less fast with good screen quality. Video conferencing is easy on this laptop. Graphic card is high so gaming is good too. Overall satisfied and good for students👍🏻😊

   The package i has received was well protected and no damage occured. After I uncovering the package and started the laptop, it was so slow compared to my old vaio (sony i7). I was disappointed when it started to process slowly. But after signing and using it, there was no problem and it was running smoothly till now. (No backlighting, no bag, no headphones and mouse) only a laptop, a charger and a manual paper.

"
"

  It looks the screen size is small . Its not look 15.6 inch. Can some one help me

"

  Laptop getting hang very much and very much slow start.This is happening within 2 days of purchase

  How to install a new SSD? The SSD does not show up on the boot menu. It shows ""Toshiba"" as the first boot device even after physically removing the preinstalled Toshiba hard disk and connecting a new SSD.

  HiThis is a true feedback, requesting you to now buy this laptop from here, I ordered this product and on the very next day it is getting hanged,  unable to run the apps properly. Very slow processer. Worst quality. And the worst part is customer services are not even helping they are just asking to contact hp and hp is asking to contact Amazon. I asked to return but nothing has happened. Please please do not buy this product.

  I'm satisfied with the product but it's little slow while booting up. Really,  useful to attend College and School Online classes for  my children. It's storage space is good enough.

"
"

  A really good laptop for online classes as well as for gaming.Worth money. Screen length and height is perfect! Just one problem that it doesn't have port for wired earphones. It has Bluetooth ones.

  Value for money laptop from an branded manufacturer.

  Lookwise & bodywise ok. But it is too slow and hangs a lot, dont buy it...

   The package i has received was well protected and no damage occured. After I uncovering the package and started the laptop, it was so slow compared to my old vaio (sony i7). I was disappointed when it started to process slowly. But after signing and using it, there was no problem and it was running smoothly till now. (No backlighting, no bag, no headphones and mouse) only a laptop, a charger and a manual paper.

  HiThis is a true feedback, requesting you to now buy this laptop from here, I ordered this product and on the very next day it is getting hanged,  unable to run the apps properly. Very slow processer. Worst quality. And the worst part is customer services are not even helping they are just asking to contact hp and hp is asking to contact Amazon. I asked to return but nothing has happened. Please please do not buy this product.

  11th Gen i3 laptop for less than 40K is a dream come true - With 8GB RAM, I can stop worrying about slower performance with this laptop and the 1TB HDD gives me ample space for my needs. Definitely recommend this laptop to someone looking for a hassle-free daily multitask machine.

"
"

  I liked this laptop very much..🥰🤩As I student I would recommend this to evry student....I would clearly mention that it is NOT A GAMING laptop.❌It does not mean we cant play games on it.It can run low specs / end gamesEx : Prince of Persia , Assassin creed 1 ✅It may run games like GTA 5 , CS:GO etc , but they lag terribly !!😥Good for education and learning purpose.Overall a decent laptop with a decent budget👍

  I ordered the product on Apr 8, 2021. The date of manufacturing on the box was mentioned as Mar 2021. I thought I had got a recently manufactured and quality tested and verified laptop. However, there was issue with the display. The laptop was making noise and had other issues. The amazon inspection expert order the replacement of the product after I submitted the return and refund request. I have got a replacement piece today i.e. Apr 13, 2021. This one is manufactured in Feb 2021. Will have to wait and see how this one turns out.

  I got the laptop at right time. Could you tell me How to add nvme ssd to this HP Laptop?

  Speakers not working.Annoying noise comes from speakers all the time.No sounds of videos or music.Very poor experience of buying laptop from Amazon.

  I didn't find anything in this laptop to pay such a huge amount like 43k. You can get it in 40k easily in your near stores..then why should you pay more

  I am writing this review after using it for 1 month .This is a very good purchase at this price point considering it's configurations.Though it also has some cons that i experiencedLet's talk in detailPros:1. FHD display2. SSd3. Boots within seconds4. Multitasking is decent with it5. Full Charged within 80-90 minutes6. Built quality is awesome7. Sound of the speakers are so well which is usually absent in laptops at this price range8. The DELL brandCons .1. Display should be more brighter  , u may not have this issue if u are not a Netflix person but if u watch than u will definitely agree . Even in dark  with full brightness it seems less brighty2. Battery backup is not as described i.e. 10 hours  It only runs 4-5 hours , sometimes even less than  4 hrs3. Bluetooth connection problem , while connecting  to bluetooth headset it takes a lot of time . It shows that it is connected but no sound will come in ur bluetooth headsetSo I think that's enough to describe my 1 month experience of using the product.Shi item h

  Thanks to faster delivery by Amazon in 1 day during COVID19 lockdown. This is really awesome laptop from this price range ~37 K with having 256GB SSD + 1TB Hard Disk with Intel I3 10th Gen. The windows 10 is using SSD drive for faster booting and startup process.The battery charging is happening very fast. Overall performance of the system is very good. Struggling to activate office 2019 on this system for lifetimelifetime but after seeing some videos on YouTube I was able to install office 2019 on my system.

  Finger print scanner is there.  I am very happy

"

  I bought this yesterday and the system takes a lot of time even to open edge browser. Even the windows pane takes hell of a time. I thought this is because it's the first setup... But even today after a complete restart, same experience...my old hp is definitely 10 times faster than this new Dell laptop

"
"

  Honest opinion. Please dont waste your money on this laptop. Spend another 5000 rupees and go for HP starting range laptop. Never expected DELL to cheat their consumers. You will need immediate RAM update as soon as you buy. Wont work woth 4GB. Please dont waste money on this laptop

"

  I buy this laptop for word call service by dellBut dell not  provied any serviceAnd don't by dell laptop for serviceGot for other company  like acer and hpAndMy old review-They does not provide fast adapter.

  I have always liked the sturdiness of the Dell Vostro series and Inspiron series. This laptop offers the right balance to be able to WFH.Pros:1. It has a 256 GB SSD and a 1 TB hard drive. Best Laptop to WFH with a 14 inch screen. The size and weight is perfect and the whole laptop feels sturdy.2. Sturdy laptop from a known brand.The screen brightness even at its highest setting does not glare at you. However, I read that a netflix user didn't feel it was adequate for long hours of viewing. I feel that this type of screen might actually help but its an individual preference.3. During first install, it said there's only an office trial and asked me for credit card details. Though disappointed, I decided to login and check. I was able to activate MS Office without paying extra. So, just skip the office trial instructions during first setup.4. Comes with 4 GB RAM but can be upgraded up to 16 GB if required later. Needs to be upgraded anyways.5. Came for about 33.5K using HDFC offers during the Great Amazon sale for Prime users. The next day, when I recommended it to friends, found out that the price had been bumped to 43K. Lucky to get this deal.Now Mi has introduced i3 35K laptops with 1500 credit card discounts. So, take your pick.For 43K you might want to go for MI i5 horizon Laptops or other more powerful laptops but its a personal choice.Cons:1. It is not a gaming laptop. At the same time, its a matte type of screen, hence you will not see the full sharpness in videos. May change with settings but this is my observation so far.2. The battery life stated is 10 hours but it gives around 4 - 6 hours depending on use.3.  Update after a few days of use, found that it lags a great deal when using VPN or Citrix. After a further investigation, found that it was a network/citrix issue and even by i5 lagged a lot but handled the situation a bit better than this i3 laptop. Hence, I would say that if you do not have Citrix issues, this is good for WFH as well.You can go for it since is a good budget option for students / WFH.

  1. Nice look and feel2. Power button with print sensor which helps quick login.3. Play high resolution videos nicely.4. Keys are Good. Some keys found little hard.5. Power button doesn't work every time until u have to press hard.6. Facing some driver update issue. lets see if could solve it myself.7. Lifetime windows 10 and Office :-)8. Laptop is little heavy :-(

  I was very sceptical to buy this laptop after seeing so many negative reviews. Most of the people are facing mainly 2 problems 1. It is very slow and hangs. 2. Office is free for only one month. Office is lifetime free but not office 365, which is free for 1 month only. Many people don’t understand this difference and believe that they are being cheated. Now coming to the hanging issue, let me be very frank that I also faced this issue for 2 days and even decided to return the laptop. Luckily I realised that I am always getting one cloud app error. This app works only with office 365 and since I was using normal office, I decided to uninstall this app. After that I have not faced any hanging issue.

"
"

  its good

"

  out of the box it will work dead slow, u will think this config is not compatible with win 10, or there is some problem with the laptop,but after upgrading its window patches ( 3, 4 upgrades will take 2-- 3 hours )  and upgrade  all drivers from dell, it will work normally,advisable: disable mccafe antivirus,  and use windows defender, and close or uninstall unwanted apps and services from startup.its best performance can be get from a ssd version or with minimum  8gb ram,good part is, it has slot for ssd , and extra ram slot, it can be upgraded easily to add extra 8 gb ram and 256gb extra ssd, at around (4k ) ,i have not upgraded will do it later,i was ordering a ssd version , but somehow it get swapped to this one during final ordering as ssd was becoming out of stock every now and then,but due to amazon policy, we cannot return or change to another laptop, they can only replace with same model, if u have any issue.its advisable to buy a ssd version of this same laptop, or atleast 8gb ram varient.display : full hd ,great.thin and lightweight  ,body seemes durable,hinges are strong,battery backup: 4- 5 hours.windows 10 and office included.

"
"

  This is good laptop I am so Happy must buy.Nice displayRuns really smoothBoots up within secondsGood built qualityEnough storage space(1 tb hdd+ 256 gb ssd)Inbuilt web camera is not good enoughBattery backup is not good as expectedGo for it without thinking!!!!The laptop is worth buying under 37k!!!!

"
"

  The product arrived ahead of time , the laptop in it’s original packing  was packed in an amazon box with no fillers to prevent it from getting tossed around .Infact the delivery boy was playing with it by flipping it inside when I went to the gate to receive it .The description says MS office however that is only a one month free trial version and one must buy the original at a price of 5 K ... I personally feel it’s misleading because windows 10 and ms office for our primary requirement when finalising the product .We have yet to transfer data from the other machine to this new one , on the surface of it looks fine , operates well .Will make another detailed review post 1 month use .

"
"

  My earlier two laptops were of HP. This is first time I opted n purchased Dell Vostro 3491. At this price range of 35-37 K its a marvelous machine. I have used it for about a week  for personal use n its ultimate. Let me give plus and minus:Plus: 1. Full HD, clear vision even at 178 degree.2. 1TB + 256 SSD which is extremely  fast in any processing activity.  Booting takes hardly 10 seconds.3. Clear and loud sound compared to other brands.nice speaker good for movies n web callings.4. 10th gen i3 processor fast n reliable for all your needs.5. Extremely slim n light Weight about 1.7 kg highly portable n easy handling.6. Spill resistance surface n easy grip outer portions thus better safety.7. Its Dell (India) a nice brand name with good online n otherwise support.8. Easy booting with finger print sensor. Well positioned n soft keys.Minus: 1. Need more brightness specially  while watching movies n videos. Other wise ok.2. Some time there is a delay in Bluetooth connectivity but not always.3. Though the company claims battery  back of 11 hrs but practically  it will give you 4-5 hrs only. But the charging is fast n doesn't  take longer time.Overall the minus are not that serious but Plus are all of high value. So go for it. It's excellent.

  Initial experience is very important and thats where all mess happens.I got the laptop and see MS office is missing. I tried to raise request in DELL SUpport. It just says it cant create Support request.I tried for remote support and there is no session.How the hell can I interact for support?Want to add more now. This is just useless when explorer doesnt open within 10 minutes. tried all options of optimization, trouble shoots etc. It is just unbearable. Dont get trapped by the price. It is not worth buying even at 10000 INR.

"

  Close your eyes and hit a buy button 😀This is the best laptop in 40k rangeI bought this for my sister for her online classesBut this is also good for mid level analysis/programming , for high level you need to upgrade ram to 8/16 GBStorage is also nice ,especially SSDfinger print sensor works smoothlyI got this delivery 1 day before the promised day by amazonOnly cons is overheating charger while chargingThis laptop is always out of stockEven I searched in entire pune and Bangalore but this product was available nowhere ,Also this is a business laptop so you can't buy this from dell's official website , if you want to do so you have to provide GSTIN number,even if you provide GSTIN number it takes 25 days to deliver  so I was not able to buy from dell's website as well.After keeping an eye for 3-4 days I placed order at midnight 1am 😅And got it within 3 daysWindows 10 is pre installed plus windows office is also availableSo overall performance is very good in such a budgetSatisfied with this productThank you

"
"

  Got the laptop recently. So far so good. Decent performance, quite suitable for students with less multi tasking requirements. Anti-glare screen is helpful for kids video schooling. Pre-loaded windows 10 and office is a definite plus.Remember you are buying core i3 (not i7) and hence will have to settle for slightly lesser speed.

  Honest review after using it 7daysAs I ordered it on 19 and i get it by 20 i was trying to replace it by 20oct but amazon and dell not helping me it started giving me heat up issue after 1hr only then next day i went to authorize service center of dell the worst service provided by them they updated the system but so just heat up prb solve but it taking 3min  for restart the system still the person said there is no prb they are not helping at all just because it has purchased from amazon and online the useless people andStill i cant upload the video that is too big the system is too much slow and not working properly if u have to work on excel it will not support 5mb file also its slow that for deleting a single cell its taking 20 min i m really now frusted but as its last day for replacement i have request amazon plz try too understand then they have replace it after 7 days so guyss other than that laptop look is very nice but performance is not good so think andTry to go for hpHoping best for replacement product will write next review after 6days

  Worst product.Very very slow in function.It can't even handle basic Word and Excel files.I am writing this review after about 24 days of purchase from Amazon.Dell has simply cheated  by  launching this product.It's 4GB memory is worthless.This configuration is absolutely useless.Office 19 provided with it is not perfectly compatible with the OS in it.It hangs up every now and then while opening of Word and Excel files every single time.I requested Amazon and Dell to replace this faulty device.But they are not bothered at all.A poorly conceived and configured laptop.Its basic aim to cheat customers by showing inbuilt office 19 , Windows 10 with 1TB HD.Its all useless.I am finding difficulty even handling simple MS office functions.Dell customer services has admitted themselves in their response that with the provided 4GB RAM ; of which the OS occupies major portion makes it difficult for other works to function smoothly.Amazon support is nil.Dell support is pathetic.They (Dell) have lied repeatedly to look into the matter employing classic delaying tactics.It's a sheer waste of money.I am planning to move consumer court to put this case.Its very clear that Dell has intentionally put forward this product to market, fully knowing about its inefficacy only to somehow sell it.Its all about cheating, forgery and fraudulent trade practice.So it's a big No..No ..No from me.

"

  Today after first day of usage observed that battery life is not as per what is stated in product description, it's lasts only for 4 hours maximum. Hope it gets better day by day of usage. Should provide document about how to activate MS Office. Rest all features are excellent and as per the product description. Its value for Money for sure. The laptop body is finger magnet leaves behind lots of traces on the body. Good budget laptop overall. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome. Multi functional track pad is too good.

"
"

  Bought the laptop a month ago. The laptop has hung twice. Unmute function on meeting platforms take longer than usual to activate! Another strange phenomenon... has ants coming out of the keyboard every now and then. Called Dell customer care. Have been asked to take to service centre for investigation. Not a very good early experience!

"
"

  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, I bought during the big billion day. The laptop is way too slow have been trying to get in touch with the customer services of Dell, they are saying there is a software issue. I tried to do whatever they asked me to do, I even took Holiday to finish the set up. Even after sitting for 7 hours they couldn't resolve when I asked them to send a service person or I'll visit the service center they are asking for money. Warranty is on hardware and not on software. I understand the policy but if the laptop is not letting me install the os isn't it their responsibility to get this fixed? Even after reinstalling os it is not responding, they are not ready to agree it is their fault. And for replacement they will take time off 45 days even for that they haven't confirmed if they will do it

"
"

  The laptop was extremely slow and the operating system crashed on the same day. Apps would take long time to open or screen became unresponsive. Even the booting was slow. In a brand new laptop without any downloaded files, this is surprisingly. A technician came and checked and said several people facing same issues. He said he'll report the problem and help with replacement. Surprisingly, Amazon told me he reported just the opposite. So beware of people checking your machines. They are least bothered in helping you. I am still waiting for resolution or a replacement or refund. Very disappointing experience.

"
"

  This product is delivered today and after initial setup, I see the laptop is very slow. Restart takes atleast 5-8 mins to be in ready state. I am planning to return it.

"
"

  I purchased this laptop on 17th October 2020. And in just 1 & half months laptop screen blacked out & when i went to dell service center i was told that motherboard is damaged. I don't think a brand new laptop was delivered to me. This experience is rightly converting a perception to a fact that ""No matter what, don't purchase expensive electronic items like laptops online"".

  Fast service,got it in 7 days big brand Dell,1tb+256 ssd,i310gen,ms office windows,1.76kg weight 1920×1080 fhd 14 inch ,all in 37840rs.All keypad screen battery full charge in 80 mint.Just an awesome deal if u wanna a lap under 38k the best to go.. Close your eyes & order it..You will get the best configuration model brand&specification.....Thanks

"
"

  I was very dissapointed after using it, it was very slow....taking 2 to 3 minutes for booting....hang a lot..then i noticed in task manager that it was because of 85 to 90 percentage of ram use..then i ordered a ddr4 4gb ram, it cost me Rs1299...and now it is working like a charm...booting time reduces to one minute..and never hangs since....I am very happy now...

  The storage capacity is 1TB HDD and not SSD... BOOTING is very slow. Not worth to spend 35k for this laptop. Most importantly Amazon customer service TL Navneet told me to check product physically before buying it 😂

  Many people have complained about the slowness of this laptop. Yes, it was very slow during the set up. With 4gb ram and 5400 rpn hdd inside, one should not expect blazing fast performance. After set up, I upgraded the ram to 12 gb and changed the 1 tb hdd to 500 gb ssd. The back cover is very easy to open and to my surprise the motherboard has 2 independent ram slots which can accommodate 2×8 gb ram modules. Many other laptops of Acer, Lenovo etc. have the ram unit inbuilt to the mother board which leaves only one slot for the user to upgrade. Mi laptops doesn't have any ram slots to upgrade. Though officially not declared, the slots can even support 2×16 gb modules as per certain upgrade advice sites. The 4gb ram provided is of 3200 mhz and not 2666 mhz as mentioned in the Dell website. Before upgrading, it will be better to confirm the ram frequency using softwares like cpuz to ensure proper matching. Only disappointment is that it doesn't have m2 ssd slot for upgrade. After the upgrade, the laptop is blazing fast and the performance is very good.

  The laptop is very gud for online classes.  I bought it for a teacher.  It comes preloaded with windows and office. The Webcam clarity is gud. Sound is alo gud enough.I bought additional 4gb ddr4 2666v crucial ram and wd 120gb m2 ssd.It's a delite to open this laptop.Pls make sure to configure the office license onto a Outlook.com ID, or else, you would lose the office license. After doing so, I reinstalled windows on the m2 ssd.Post this, the laptop is super fast and handles any kind of load. Sadly, it doesn't have finger print scanner.Hope it answer's all your queries.

  Brilliant laptop! This is the best laptop in this range.Sturdy, lightweight, good performance,nice display, surprisingly best sound quality, excellent camera 720p. Everything is the best and up to the mark.MS OFFICE student version comes free with this and its smooth.Strong recommendation:- Add 8GB RAM then you will experience the full potential rocket performance of i3.I havent put much photos, but rather talk about its performance. I am super happy with this laptop.

  Cheating by Amazon customer care service for not return/ refund by postponing the service visit and closing without user concerns and rectifying the issues. Worst experience, laptop is working very slow. Feel like working 10 years back, when PC speed was 250MB RAM.Definitely look for a better laptop and don't waste your money.Go to showroom and get hands-on experience before buying any laptop. Amazon support service is very poor on post delivery support service and awaiting for 04 days for their technician visit.Nor technician is visiting for service, or Amazon is arranging return/refund

  Bought the product on 2nd October and got delivery on 8th October. Writing review after 2 weeks. So for good. The one good thing I like about this product is it starts up so fast, that you could not imagine the speed. Also the windows registration was very smooth. Just plug and play like TV. I would say overall a decent buy. Need to see how it goes after 6 months.

"
"

  I read alot of negative reviews and all of them belonged to the 1TB HDD version,then I read positive and all of them belonged to the 1TBHDD+256GBSSD.If you can squeeze a little more money, PLEASE go for the 1+256 version, the boot speed is blazing fast, the processing speed is good, writing the review after a week and no issues so far. For those who think Microsoft office isn't included *THAT'S NOT THE CASE* when windows takes you through the Setup process, please create an Outlook account and *USE THE SAME ID PASSWORD* for Office sign up. Then you'll be getting Free lifetime Student 2019 office, which is PPT, Word and excel, exactly what we need.The brightness is a little disappointing on self adjust, you can change the setting ofc.Rest all is good. You can go for this.(P.S. I've used the laptop strictly for light to medium work usage, I don't know if it can handle games but it has integrated Intel graphics and also a built in app that can tell what games it can take and also optimises gaming performance)

"
"

  What I liked: it has a huge storage space. Price tag is reasonable. Progamming software is in the SSD, so it starts up by about 15 secs, which is much quicker than those without SSD. Shutdown is even faster. No bloatware.My Dislikes,Extremely poor built!! Keyboard sags down with each keystroke...eeks!! Screen and keyboard are dirt magnets. There are much smaller sized 14 laptops in market, sizewise too its quite large for the screen size.Initially there were some screen problems.. amazon washed its hands off saying ""please contact Dell"". And its not easy to contact dell people! Luckily, blips on my screen resolved.. hope it says that way.

"
"

  The product i would say avarage. But i suggest you to take the ssd and 8Gb memory variant (available in dell site).I noticed with the HDD the system takes 1:30 min to boot up. Which is horrible in 2020. However i had one ssd which is installed and now it takes 11 sec to boot up.Overall performance is good. If you are not a heavy user, then go for it (et student, WFH)

"
"

  Ordered the laptop as a gift after seeing the initial reviews. All the reviews were positive when the reviews were 112. But did not find the product as good as the reviews by people. Gets easily heated. Some keys wont work on first click. you have to click twice. Looks like a not so standard product from dell. Now when I check the recent reviews by people, every one is unhappy. Thanks for amazon for providing the refund after inspection.

"
"

  Bought this in 4gb 1tb varient, found it slow during initial uses, enhanced the performance by reducing battery saving feature of Windows10, noticed decent change in the performance but not as I wanted, upgraded it with 250gb nvme ssd and what??? it started working surprisingly fast...Suggestion: Laptop is decent according to the price. Windows10 needs SSD necessarily for running the system. Purchase the SSD model or Buy HHD model in lesser amount and upgrade it by your end to save upto 4-5k.Surely this will help!

"
"

  Product is awesome at it price and and dual storage for faster booting and multitasking.. However I believe that product was made in China hence was pushed for lower price...

"
"

  Elegant laptop at this price point. Brand Dell.256GB SSD makes big difference.. i3 processor is more than enough for most of the work. As of now don't feel the need for additional memory,4GB feels all Ok.  Just go for it. Well worth it.

"
"

  The description says the processor is up to 3.4GHz but the one we get is 1.4GHz. The description is totally wrong. even after speaking to Amazon they didn't respond properly.please don't buy the processor is too slow .Dell cheated ie their description is wrong. If we check the other company description they hav correctly mentioned but Dell it's wrong. Buy and update the processor for a better performance.

"
"

  Performance is not up to the mark, you will not be satisfied with it at all. I'm looking for option to return it, so that I can purchase the better Dell or other product !

"
"

  I am not satisfied with performance and quality I put returning option and from customer care they refused to refund and even opt for replacement for which they also refused my question is why I am keeping technical defect product Amazon management should answer me

"
"

  Something i disliked about product is that keyboard provide by dell is very compatible and compress i would say if This product is available in 15.6 inch instead of 14 inch so that i must say dell vostro 3491 is best product under this price ..one more Thing i don't like in this product is I use this product only a month and my keyboard key is not properly worked..

"
"

  This is a very slow computer. After configuring for the first time, I was not able to land to the login screen and it was in hang state for quite a long time. Any further attempt to login took a long long time. I tried to return and upgrade the laptop, but unfortunately Amazon's policy does not allow. May be for India region.I purchased the 4 GB variant and then purchased an additional RAM. I would recommend going for a higher configuration for better system performance.

"
"

  Delivery was on time. Product was fine. No damages or any other issues. After booting up and setting up the laptop i noticed there’s an unusual lag almost every time when i use my lap. It does not hang up. Its just slow. Looking at the fact that its an i3 laptop, it surely does not deliver the speed of an i3 processor, i mean my intel pentium lap was wayyy more faster than this and didn’t have any lag or hang. Im talking about basic use, like browsing and watching movies and Microsoft office etc etc. When i open ‘my computer’ or any other folder it takes like 8 seconds to open that folder. WTF. It is so slow that im starting to lose my temper. The laptop design is very nice actually its very compact n all but the processing speed is very unusually slow. I would recommend going for another brand other than dell. Im just trying to console myself of the fact that i didn’t waste my money on this laptop.

"
"

  1.Booting speed is awesome2.At this price point this product is best for you3.fingerprint is available4.display quality is also good5.If your budget is below 40,000 then you must have to buy this laptop

"
"

  The laptop is slow and shutdown in between..... Even for a I3 10th Gen.....In middle of the presentation meeting the laptop got stuck and went for restart....Have requested a laptop service check from amazon and found some issues in hardware.....Will be returning this laptop to amazon...Hope they will be rectify there problems ASAP.Disappointed in Dell.

"
"

  Laptop takes quite sometime to boot and be ready mainly because of the present hardware configuration. With addition of ssd or increase in RAM speed should increase as seen from comments of a better laptop that amazon offered later at a nominal higher price. In all amazon & dell managed to push a inferior product which they are offering at a lower price but not worth it. For light use such as myself the present configuration may work but thinking of increasing RAM to 8gb later. The bundled up windows and ms office were trial versions and was asked to pay an hefty sum for 1 year license

"
"

  Good build quality. The battery lasts 4 hours or so after one full charge. The performance is good for my usage. I use it mainly to do office work. The laptop boots up fast. The only slight quibble I have with it is about the keyword. Its Home and End keys are not making text selection easier like in some of the other Dell laptops. For me, this is not a big issue. I bought the laptop for 36890, and would recommend buying it for this price.

"
"

  I don't usually write reviews but I hope, for someone this might be helpful to make decision with ease.I am writing this review after 3months of  usage.After tons of research, I have chosen this laptop as it best suits my needs...Being an engineering student, its very helpful for me despite of its 4gb RAM. However, in near future as per the necessity, it can be expanded. The X-factor that interested me in this laptop is its 1tb HDD alongside with 256gb SSD.It's super smooth while working and pretty fast(As it has ssd ).It has a 14-inch  FHD display & as the name says is it all, the display is good. The only thing that could be better is it's battery (It can last till 4-5 hrs ),it doesn't affect me much as I am not a heavy user. You can buy it without any second thought, if you feel it fits your needs like as mine.

"
"

  This particular product comes with Windows 10 Home edition version 2004. Now the problem with version 2004 is not all updates are given inside. So when you install Intel Extreme Tuning Utility in it and try to overclock, it wont be possible as of now. Unless Microsoft provides all the driver updates for this version.The product is slow in terms of working. Its lags behind in great amount, even when you are typing on MS Word.

"
"

  Of you are buying dell products then please know that they won't help you if there is any fault with their softwares, you will have to do it on your own even if the product is in warranty. Within 2 months headphone port stopped working and the dell serveice centre is absolutely doing nothing. Their technician came just to tell me that he can't do anything. Never ever buy dell. Worst brand.

"
"

  Folks, I purchased this laptop only to realize that my previous laptop Celeron Dual Core Pentium processer was faster than this i3. My humble request is no to get carried away by the price and land in trouble.Secondly, Amazon played a clever trick, if you see the ratings, most of the 1 star was given for poor installation or service not done having paid Rs. 700/-  This was to distract the ratings from actual product review, which mean there are no reviews about the product. Misleading way to con customers. Boot time close to a minute, opening MS Teams add another minute... very very slow....

"
"

  I bought this Laptop for my personal use and It met my expectation. SSD helps in fast boot time. Best value for money. No laptop has this features in this price. I found this laptop best after long research.4GB RAM is not enough if you want to run more applications/Gaming. Sometimes the FAN noise is annoying when the memory goes high.MS Office works fine. Overall a Good laptop

"
"

  There is problem with this model. Disk utilization in task mamager always shows 100% utilization. Dell support guys install/updates multiple drivers but still it's 100% which is causing very slow performance. There is no resolution from Dell for this issue.. So don't buy this product. You can Google 100% disk activity dell vostro and will get lot of guys complaining still Dell unable to solve.Look for some other brand and avoid Dell.

"
"

  the laptop delighted me very much. m wiritng this review from this laptop only. Very light weight nd stylish body. great display and good battery backup. SSD is best part .botting takes place in less than 6 7 seconds. GO for this product without second thought.

"
"

  I did a lot of research on online shopping websites. Considering that Dell is a renowned brand, i think this is a pretty decent laptop at this price.

"
"

  It comes with Genuine Windows Home + lifetime MS office + 1.5 year McAfee Antivirus..Wonderful combination.1 TB of storage and 256 GB M2 makes it butter smooth in terms of execution of programs..It comes with 4GB RAM. Added one more 4GB crucial stick. Works like champ.Overall I am satisfied with it.

  The best laptop at this price range. With 256GB SSD, it has superb response. With 1 TB SATA disk, you don't need worry about Disk space to store anything. It is i3 (10th Gen) processor, but with SSD, it performs faster than i5 processor. Good camera, FHD screen and good battery life.Bought it for my daughter's online class, she is loving it.

"
"

  Sturdy laptop, gorgeous screen, amazingly smooth keyboard, pre-installed windows 10, free Office 2019 licence all at a great VFM price point, so ticks most boxes  but with one fatal flaw - 4gb RAM is simply not enough. Struggled with everything -booting, loading even simple programs, restart, updates, even browsing one tab on chrome.. thankfully there is an additional SODIMM slot so added 8gb additional RAM and now everything is great.GB

"
"

  I seen many comments, they saying that laptop is slow. Who ever says that ,They are nubs.......Becoz in first place there are lot off updates are going in laptops background and lots off updates need to start manualy, when i complete that process, laptop started to running like a champ....giving me what i supposed to get from this price range........ Seriously whoever saying that laptop is slow, they are noobs... Confirmed......they are realy dont know about computing...this laptop have 4gb ram and first day laptop tasks are prity heavy for that.

"
"

  The laptop looks good, this is the only positive thought I can think of. I have used this laptop for 3 days straight now. It hangs several times while performing basic operations like surfing the internet to just using a word or Excel sheet. Takes forever to boot. This configuration is not useful even if you intend to use it for entertainment or for a nline studies (for yourself or your kid's online classes). The sheer slow response and hanging will drive you crazy. I've raised a ticket with Dell support and following the guidance they've provided on chat (no calling option). They've requested me to run ""support assist"" and the device has hanged while doing the same. Honestly, my suggestion to anyone reading this is "" DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP"" no matter what any of the other positive comments say. My kind heads up to anyone planning to walk this path, just turn away, don't waste your time and money. Hope the review helps you.

"

  The keyboard is working wrongly. The @ symbol is wrongly shown as "" symbol.

  very good

"

  Bought this thinking that dell was a good brand and amazon was a trusted platform. the laptop is supposed to be loaded with MS office. When it came, it was msoffice was some kind of a cloud version. The new laptop was extremely slow. I intended to return it immediately but amazon said thats not possible. They will send someone to service it. The service guys called and said that they cant do anything about the speed. will need to upgrade the RAM. Nothing as such is mentioned in the product listing. Now its become even slower. Reminds me of assembled computers during my school days. Dell has lost it quality totally. And i had trusted amazon all these years. Used to by with my eyes shut.NOT ANYMORE... AMAZON you are not as good as before!!!

"
"

  Returned the next day, too slow. The memory was too low to have processes like chrome and excel. Vostro is supposed to be a business laptop, every process took so much of time to process in this laptop hence returned it. The return process was also not easy since amazon first replaces the product to another product and then finally return your money back after the second product is also returned. Seemed like a good deal at the proce but 4gb ram is a deal breaker. You may have to invest in another 4gb ram to make it work properly but then the total outlay goes high and there are many laptops available which give you a 8gb config

"
"

  Pretty nice laptop!It has all things that seller had said.You must go for it. If you want.It has 4 GB RAM. 2 slots of RAM are given. Clocked at 2666MhzIntel UHD graphics.You can play Battlefield 5 and 1. Call of duty Black ops all series at 30 -40 fps.For playing other titles you'd need GPU dedicated.It has fingerprint sensor too!Mic too! Core i3 10th gen processor with turbo boost technology. Base clock is 1.9Ghz and can boost to 3.4. GHz I think.Just go for its best 💻 in its range.

   Like : Coming to product very good quality, display quality is awesome, keypad/ touch pad  is very good. camera quality is good anti scratch body too good. Eco friendly laptop very good for travel purpose.Dislike : Coming to battery back it's disappointed, it's just work for 3-4 hrs as company mention 10hrsAfter product received first 45min there is a lot of hanging issue after update it's work fine.Cost of the product is 35300/- but there is not finger print sensor available.Overall according to my analysis for office use or for student it is very very good product. But for  high performing application you might be face challenge for this laptop.

"
"

  This laptop take much time to start . Service center says that need to replace the hard disk for this version. So why the hell did I buy, to replace the parts after purchasing. It was slow from the first day. Dell plz stop cheating, this version is not going to work properly (according to Dell service center) bcoz there is no other solution apart from changing hard disk.

"
"

  I used this laptop for 3 days .Display - 5 /5Performance- 4/5Look - 4/5Good laptop for this budget . Please buy and expect will be fulfilled after two days of buying . Bcos windows update shows some slowness for 1st 2 days .

"
"

  I've bought it recently and I'm kind of satisfied according to it's price range. The main and most satisfying feature is actually it's performance for that I bought it. Display is just okay, missing backlid keyboard is noticeable, speakers output is also okay and the most worthless feature of this laptop is it's battery life. Laptop's hinge is very hard while opening the lid, can't open with one hand. In specifications it was showed that it has inbuilt fast charging (but I didn't find that). I only bought it for performance & SSD and that I received. My headphone jack stopped working after single week of purchasing but that sometimes happens. And they are providing on-site warranty (GOOD).

"
"

  The Laptop is hanging even without running any applications. I reported Dell and they suggested to upgrade RAM. I asked the quote for the RAM but didn't get quote even after repeated reminder for two weeks. Finally I have to order by my own. Now speed is good but hanging problem is still there. Unfortunately, there is nobody to listen.

"
"

  I received good Quality Dell Laptop 4GB/1TB&256GB.  Good Performance. Microsoft Edge browser hangs. Download chrome. Recommended to buy SSD strorage laptops performance good. I got both 1 TB and 256GB SSD. so that I interested and bought. Battery 4:30-5:30 hr for heavy works.  Seller: Appario Private LTD

"
"

  I have exchanged this laptop twice due to no return / refund provided and both the times the product performance was pathetic.. CPU and Disk gets to 100% without opening any apps.. very very slow booting and unable to work on apps, very bad and frustrating experience. Please do not waste your time to buy this even if you get it for free!!

"
"

  Very very slow.unable to open the edge browser and it dead slow.system is not responding .dead slow .on top of this delivery delayedHow many times we call the dilvery guy ,he will disconnect the call and dont pick the call.no point in buying the laptop .too too slow

"
"

  within 1 week of purchase, the adapter failed and they replaced the same. within 3 of weeks of purchase, the headphone jack stopped recognizing the headphone and output was only from speakers. they tried changing the motherboard but still didnt work. dell india doesnt have any clue as what needs to be done and now coordinating with Microsoft for a solutionotherwise the product works well but disappointing to know that a reputed company with such extensive R&D doesnt have a clue on whats happening

   One of the main features which I like in this laptop is its Battery backup.I review it after use of  2 months.And the size of it is very compact specially for students.If I talk about camera quality,that is very poor but it's ok for vedio calling.

"
"

  Screen brightness is not up to the Mark. suitable for official work & not recommended for media consumption.Start up and shut down time is fast. No lag observed during usage of MS office tools.Device is light weight and easy to carry. Built quality is good but the body is finger print magnet.Yes physical finger print reader is present on the power button and response time is really fast, unlocks the device like cell phone.

"
"

  Excellent packaging by amazon,kudos to you.brand new original product and Simply outstanding value for money. A no-brainer choice of laptop 👍👍👍.

"

  Laptop is good takes hardly 10 sec to Power on and Battery backup is 6 hrs mild usage

"

  1. very slow in performance, even cursor movement takes time, website opening takes time.2. Without connecting adapter , it does not start even if sufficient charge is there.3. adapter is heating too much from the 1st ever charge itseltwould not recommend

"
"

  This LAPTOP has thought me one important thing i.e. PATIENCE.This Laptop is so so so slow from the first day that you really need to be patient enough to use it.Its takes atleast 5 mins to start. Minimum 7-8 minutes to open a word file or excel file. In my laptop there are no songs, no videos, it's fully updated but still till today it's Damm Damm slow.I'm patient now

"

  Most pathetic performance, very very slow on the day of opening. Cannot do multi task, can not open more than 3 browsing windows.

  Looks are good and its slimAnd charges really fastIts battery life is maximum 3hoursAnd with high usages it barely go above 2 hoursI think after 2000 investment on it , it will become excellent i.e 256gb ssd , it has extra slot for that.Best of the best excellent gaming device minimum 40 fps on any game you play from fortnite to gta 5 it's a great gaming device.

"
"

  if, unlike me, you care for long battery life and good display this ain't for you. You can play any game on this laptop at medium or sometimes high settings. Battery life ios not the best. 1 hour on gaming, 4-5 hours on content consumption and 3-4 on light work related thing and viewing angles are not good too. But if performance is what you want, then this is the best in the price category!

  Super fast boot in 4 second with ssd. FHD screen. Num keyboard. Super battery backup. Most valuable price. Ryzen 5 with vega 8 graphic

  Lenovo laptops are ok as long as they are within warranty period. Once warranty period overs and if you face any issues with your laptop, be ready to suffer. Service centers are worst and they don't have spare parts available with them. They don't even prefer to work with out of warranty laptops. This is my personal experience with lenovo products. So if you are planning to buy lenovo laptops, keep this in mind.

   The product was delivered earlier than expected and in good condition the touch screen feature is hard to find in laptops are this price but seriously in love with the smooth texture and display quality. Not meant for gaming but otherwise it's very good

"
"

  The device is great when it comes to built quality, performance, trackpad, etc. I specially love speakers and mainly the keyboard which has good travel and it's just a joy to type on. I also like the Chrome OS which is better than Windows when you are going for budget laptops as they work faster.But the real problem is the display, it's 720p which is good for the price, but it has colour shifting problem like an TN display. The white balance is out of this world and there is no option to change it on the chromebook. So you need to live with it. There are even times I need to bend and watch as I can't even see anything while siting in the normal position. This isn't just my device fault, this model's display is designed like that. So I am really really warning you to check the reviews on the web before buying, mainly about the display.

"
"

  It has been a week since this laptop was delivered to me and it has been performing well. However, if you are planning to use this laptop as your primary one I'd suggest to go for a windows laptop. Chromebooks are designed only for basic tasks and this is true for this chromebook too. Don't expect great performance while editing or gaming. If you are a person who's daily work involves only light browsing, video conferences and streaming videos, this laptop is just perfect for you.P.s. The touchscreen works nicely too.

"
"

  Its been 2days since the purchase. It has Super clarity vedios but audio is not upto the mark (unless you are using headset)It hanged a little bit in the 2nd day itself (maybe because i was using it for long hours) otherwise its a best choice for study purpose & light use.

"
"

  Compact, light weight, good battery backup, fast working

"
"

  Nothing is supporting, It is good for nothing,

"
"

  Take too much time to turn on.. From day one it is not working. There was no pickup return.

"
"

  Not at all.. good for students but not useful for trading

"
"

  You can't even use excel properly.. You can only buy it for using in childrens thing or chrome works.

"
"

  Good laptop, screen, touch screen etc

  Please understand that the product has very limited features like gmail, and you tube. If you are want to conduct zoom meetings or want to organise zoom meetings than this Chromebook is not for you.Word and excel features can also be used only in Gmail with limited saving options.If you want to access the systemthrough Team viewer or Any desk than this Chromebook is not for you.Oerall its not worth for money and overhyped product alluring the customers through low cost. the product does not support many apps unlike a normal laptop or computer. Please think twice before spending n this product.The features provided in it are already available in any good mobile phone along with calling facility, so if you want to purchase than go for a good windows laptop or desktop.

"

  Total waste of money better to purchase tab or mobile don't waste money on this laptop😆 better to go windows laptop

"

  People can get a significantly better Windows Laptop and convert it into a Chromebook using emulation - the easy way or replace Windows if you are a nerd.

  ######This reviews is for a Renewed Chromebook laptop of similar configuration, which I purchased on Amazon, thought to share my experience here on the brand new product as well.#####___________________________________________________________________________Great product serves the purpose very well.Pros-LightweightIts almost new product (seems just returned)Battery life is great ~10 hrs ( continuous usages)Very simple to useAll the accessories are genuineAll the Android apps works smoothlyDid not feel I need to have windows for any of my day to day work.Good sound qualityLove the build qualityUSB type c port(allows charging of mobile devices)Touchscreen is icing on cake but not much useful in your daily usage except if you play games etcCons-Wish it had 1 more USB port(not a deal breaker you can buy USB hub separately)Verdict-Best for those who have light usages of laptop with just surfing, gaming, calls documentation works.There is no lag in term of operations, works smoothly even if you keep more than 50+ tabs open.If you are mostly around internet connection this is a perfect device.However you can do all the offline work as well on G-Suite.(the way a normal laptop gets used without internet)Highly satisfied.❤️

  Good value for money..SSD makes it faster..initially I faced wifi disconnection problems so I had to reset windows to install windows fresh and get latest wifi drivers...then it worked fine..apart from that I don't see any problems in it..most of my programming code editors such as visual studio,intellij gets loaded quickly..did not experience slowness..it's lightweight, It would have been great deal if it would have type c port and backlit keyboard in this budget..but satisfied with the product from lenovo..

"
"

  Screen is delicate, it is shaking for fan air. Battery backup is not as specified. Hardly running more than 2:20 hours. Cheap plastic base cover. Reviewing it after a week usage. Could not return it now  due to only replacement policy. Please check return policy before ordering. China made low quality could not rely for longer usage. Pros is  quick boot up due to ssd. Appearance is good. Not for heavy usage.

"
"

  ........sound isn't working......WiFi isn't working....and mouse is also not working and I have returned my product and got refunded..so thanks for that .... Amazon.Nice service

"
"

  I ordered it on 19th May and received the package from Amazon on 24th may. I received the product well packed. Once i opened and checked the laptop and started going through everything then i noticed that the webcam and the microphone is not working. I tried everything from updating every thing to try install drivers manually and going through lenovo's forums. I have applied for replacement on Amazon and i will update the status after a while.

"
"

  Cool lightweight laptop . You'll love the design. 256GB SSD is giving the performance an additional push. You'll not get hanged or bored between tabs or files on multitasking. Not the best in class. But good and value for money.

"
"

  Excellent value for money product. I didn’t want to spend too much for a laptop, I needed it for some training’s which I couldn’t do on my office laptop due to restrictions etc. I have used the laptop to do some courses and for entertainment such as Netflix, amazon prime etc and am quite happy. Recently though, there was an update after which it seems that the laptops volume has gone down(which was much better to start with)! I hope this is temporary and future patches will fix it but let us hope. When I connect it to a Bluetooth speaker, it works perfect.

"
"

  The laptop build quality is extremely poor. All plastic and appears very fragile. Also, the wifi kept dropping every few seconds. Maybe its to do with drive not being updated.Even the keyboard is very unlike lenovo.Overall extremely disappointing.

"
"

  Its barely been little over 1 month since purchase and the laptop keyboard has started giving issues. Not sure if its hardware or a software issue. The key switches are responding with random other values. Tried reaching out to lenovo's customer care but the efforts went invain. Pls consider this review as a formal request for Customer support from either Lenovo or the Amazon Team.

"
"

  This laptop is working good. Only problem is body cover is little flimsy. Is it possible to add ram & HDD?

"
"

  we bought 3rd time same laptop for office work, and this is most value laptop on intel i3 platform.i seen many negative feedback about performance issue but yes. it is only 4gb soldered ram (non removable) so better to go with additional 8gb ram (4+8 gb ram) and can be replaced with blue ssd to obtain best possible performance. there is no laptop available on intel i3 latest gen platform at this price. 15"" and numerical pad is + point for perfect home use. and battery is decent as well and YES. it has wall charger which is convenient.

  This laptop is great for some basic tasks such as editing documents, making presentations, or basic web browsing. With the current ram capacity, it can't be used for high demanding tasks. It's pretty good at handling school tasks, basic office work though there are many places that Lenovo has cut corners in and that could have used improvement. It comes with an average battery life that you could expect given the size of the battery and the price point. Some flaws I noticed are the screen quality such as brightness, the really mediocre speakers, and the absolutely useless webcam. Basically, if you plan to have lot of video calls/online meetings I would avoid this laptop.Being a CS engineering student this laptop clearly won't be able to run programs such as Android Studio, Android emulator, etc. without any lag but this can be improved with the ram upgrade. However, this was bought for a cousin to assist in schoolwork as everything is moving online.Pros:*Good build quality. ( Plastic but good quality)*Port selection*Keyboard ( a joy to type in)*Inclusion of an SSD*MS Office inclusion*Lenovo Vantage SoftwareCons:*Screen ( Could have been brighter and of better quality)*Abysmal webcam*Speakers not up to par.*Battery life ( Not to bad though )I would recommend this laptop to people who have basic needs such as administration work, email checking, and schoolwork. Its priced pretty well for the specs it offers ( I was able to grab it at 35.5k + a bank offer), compared to its competitors. Maybe try upgrading the ram when u get it.Personally would wait for laptops with the new Ryzen 4000 series to get released if you are not in a rush or would wait for the price to drop again as its 38k at the time of writing.

"

  I ordered this product on 27/03/21, got it delivered on 28/03/21. However there are two things I would like to report. First its mentioned that MS Office Home & Student Edition is included in price, but I am unable to either find, install or activate same. Secondly the product warranty on Lenovo Vanatge shows from 25/02/21 to 24/02/22 where as it should be up to 27/03/2021 ie 365 days from today.

"
"

  Today is 1st day when I stated using this Laptop.First impression is not so good.The sound quality is poor & no camera sutter is available also camera quality is too bad....Picture quality is also poor.Not worth on this price range of 35,990/-.Better to buy a tablet instead of this toy box.

"
"

  Bought it for my daughter's online classes. Shocked to see the speaker quality. There is no audible sound. She has to dig her ears into it and need pin drop silence to understand her lectures.  Willing to replace it with another device which can fulfill my requirement. Request to Amazon to help please.

"
"

  The product is okay, the charger wire is not long enough , the laptop appears to be very delicatehowever the rest attributes are good and its speed is good. There should have a bag provided

"
"

  I recently purchased this Lenovo laptop and it got delivered on July 3, 2020.As per the product description in Amazon, warranty is there for 1 year. But when I checked in the laptop, it is showing that the warranty is remaining for only 231 days (Feb 2020 - Feb 2021).

"
"

  I love the laptop, but 1 star for its packaging.Packaging is very very bad, luckyly I got laptop without any damages..

"
"

  Got the product on 26th of May. After that, I found the microphone issue and then webcam. Now I was reading others review and found that I'm not the one that facing these issues. I have tried to replace the item but there is no replacement option except return. Very very disappointed.

"
"

  The biggest let down is the laptop comes only with one month trial of Mcafee antivirus. And there is no mention in the product description. Its very unfair. I have purchased an ideapad 340 before where they gave one yr subscription for Mcafee. Such details should be shared while selling the laptop. Disappointed.

"
"

  Overall it is a good Laptop for online classes and normal surfing. The camera quality and audio is below average. I would have been better if HDD was also included in the laptop along with SSD. There is no Ethernet Jack (LAN port). It is all plastic body and build quality is average. The good thing is that it comes with Windows 10 + MSOffice (Home and Student Edition).

"
"

  We received the product where microphone is not working and not able to conduct any video calls due to this, we filed a complaint and yet to hear back on the return and refund. We also haven’t received the ms office key, the screen hinges are loose. Moreover the camera quality is pathetic.

"
"

  Laptop is good but few things to note is the battery life which is decent and the flap is little delicate.

"
"

  This product is very expensive, my opinion this product price is under 25,000-30,000 only, Also SSD storage of RAM is less 256GB. In this price laptop contain 512GB SSD which better for storage.

"
"

  Overall very good. Only one problem I am facing, it is regarding battery life. Only 2hrs 30mins is practically battery life.

"
"

  Had a scratch when opened so wondered if anyone tampered it. Rest looks like a good deal compared to others.

"
"

  It says 1 year, but it's showing on receiving 8 months in the lenovo site. Now lenovo has restored the warranty to 1 year after contacting them. This laptop's screen is cheap and sometimes show as blurred. I've never seen this with HP laptops

"
"

  I don't think anyone can get better then this at this range.value for money yeah it would be good if it had a metal body but still it's awesome,note not for game purposes.It is mainly build for students and professionals it is best at this range.

"
"

  Its good if u r looking laptop for professional work, its not to run heavy softwares or games, its a basic laptop but best in this budget, it has only one ssd of 256gb but thats good as it comes with an extra hdd slot so u can install one easily, i did it. Its good one, u can go for it.

"
"

  Initial setup and using for online classes were seamless, thanks AmazonHad a thought in mind that this is Chinese, except this it's all good

"
"

  For office purpose, excel work normal usage it's very good ..very good in budget segment laptop's...all application, software's will work on thisCons- McAfee is a trial based so you need to buy full version ..battery Is little lag ..

"
"

  Good value for money, sleek and delivery on time

"
"

  It's a good laptop best suited for first time laptop buyer's. You can play light games such as asphalt 9 but the only con was the battery life - it was only 2.5 hours with Bluetooth on. Turning it off might improve the battery life.

"
"

  The volume has suddenly gone low...can somebody attend to it? Any contact nos to call service ?

Don't make the mistake which I've made.I've tried changing the colour settings, still there not much change. It's a hardware problem. I feel cheated.

  This is a very good laptop with very good features and with the price range of below 40,000 this is one of the best laptops that is available right now in the market.With the given specs of full HD screen 4GB RAM 1 TB hard disk. This laptop comes with a good feel touch and finish.If you are finding this laptop on the pricing note then trust me this laptop is all worth it.

"
"

  It's very very slow, don't recommend even for students. I bought this one for my son. it takes hours to open any application/ program

"
"

  This laptop cannot available at offline market,  There is a shortage in the offline market, I bought this laptop Rs 34,000 from Amazon,1) design is very good, thin and light weight.2) battery backup 3.5 hour in video playing and full 100% charge in 2 hour,3) display is good, colour & brightness is nice,4) sound is ok,5) keyboard  very smooth,weak point,1) camera quality is poor,2) Performance is a  slow,( Don't buy this model, it doesn't have fast charging)(Go to Lenovo's other model (81W10057), in this model fast charging available,

"
"

  Not sure how such a nice laptop has so few reviews and it seems it is not available anymore. Beats me. This is a very good laptop with very good features and a sub 35K price tag. Will update if I find any issues. But so far so good. And it comes with Win10 and MS Office preloaded. Please note this is not a hardy one for regular travel, rough use or gaming.

"
"

  I'm very disappointed by Lenovo what kind of laptop they are manufacturing most of the laptop are lagging. I was fool to go with this Lenovo ideapad 15.6"" I regret myself why I did not go Acer or Asus laptop which comes with good specification now Lenovo should stop making fool to their customer. Usually I did give this kind of review but I'm facing lot of issue with this cheap laptop

"
"

  Worst...never buy this product ever....very slow and poor configuration....highly disappointed

"
"

  Best product you should buy it .It is perfect for student . But for Gamer it is not perfect. Student should buy it. Seller service is also best .Thank you

"
"

  Great product for the price. Only we struggled hard to find the privacy shutter for the camera. It is almost camouflaged with the edge of the laptop.

  Waste of money this don't worth it, please don't go for this, slow and not working this the second laptop which I got from Amazon, the first was with no backup (battery) and this was not working idle in home screen I am returning this product back to Amazon please don't go for this

"
"

  The processing speed is Very very slow.As it is Light weight,its display panel is shaking for normal Sealing Fan air,rigidity is not upto the mark...Have to handle it like a Glass,that too while opening & Closing of the lap utmost care is needed.

"
"

  This is a very good laptop with very good features and with the price range of below 40,000 this is one of the best laptops that is available right now in the market.With the given specs of full HD screen 4GB RAM 1 TB hard disk. This laptop comes with a good feel touch and finish.If you are finding this laptop on the pricing note then trust me this laptop is all worth it.

"
"

  It's very very slow, don't recommend even for students. I bought this one for my son. it takes hours to open any application/ program

"
"

  This laptop cannot available at offline market,  There is a shortage in the offline market, I bought this laptop Rs 34,000 from Amazon,1) design is very good, thin and light weight.2) battery backup 3.5 hour in video playing and full 100% charge in 2 hour,3) display is good, colour & brightness is nice,4) sound is ok,5) keyboard  very smooth,weak point,1) camera quality is poor,2) Performance is a  slow,( Don't buy this model, it doesn't have fast charging)(Go to Lenovo's other model (81W10057), in this model fast charging available,

"
"

  Not sure how such a nice laptop has so few reviews and it seems it is not available anymore. Beats me. This is a very good laptop with very good features and a sub 35K price tag. Will update if I find any issues. But so far so good. And it comes with Win10 and MS Office preloaded. Please note this is not a hardy one for regular travel, rough use or gaming.

"
"

  I'm very disappointed by Lenovo what kind of laptop they are manufacturing most of the laptop are lagging. I was fool to go with this Lenovo ideapad 15.6"" I regret myself why I did not go Acer or Asus laptop which comes with good specification now Lenovo should stop making fool to their customer. Usually I did give this kind of review but I'm facing lot of issue with this cheap laptop

"
"

  Worst...never buy this product ever....very slow and poor configuration....highly disappointed

"
"

  Best product you should buy it .It is perfect for student . But for Gamer it is not perfect. Student should buy it. Seller service is also best .Thank you

"
"

  Great product for the price. Only we struggled hard to find the privacy shutter for the camera. It is almost camouflaged with the edge of the laptop.

"
"

  Waste of money this don't worth it, please don't go for this, slow and not working this the second laptop which I got from Amazon, the first was with no backup (battery) and this was not working idle in home screen I am returning this product back to Amazon please don't go for this

"

  This product is value for money, it gets a little slow sometimes but the lenovo support team is very helpful when ever needed. Overall it is a good product.

"
"

  It's not to good.

"
"

  System not working properly after 25 days

"
"

  Need upgradation after purchase!!!It needs a NVME SSD & RAM upgrade as the HDD bottlenecks the Processor.

"
"

  Nice product original product received from seller value for money thickness anti glare display

"
"

  Worst laptop ever I had bought, I suggest don't buy this laptop hang too much

"
"

  Gud laptop for students

"
"

  Wifi connection issue..is there any button to turn on wifi in keyboard

"
"

  Excellent configured laptop for everyone....Amazing

"
"

  Dont go for this product very much slow

"
"

  Good

"
"

  I bought this laptop in the offline market ...I dont know why it is not available online in amazon ...we can not find it even in Lenovo online store also ...but this laptop is simply superb ...I dont know whether lenovo discontinued this laptop production because it's not even visible in their official website

"
"

  Myth has gone, Lenovo introduce a new fabulous machine...all are good but battery is 4+ hour back up in normal browing ...Best thing is there is no abnormal heating issue ...and fan sound is so less...overall a good laptop under 30k ,I think it is better than i3 7th gen...and speed is good..for students and office work...but I am not a gammer...you may upgade ur ram for light gaming...fast charging

"
"

  Bought it offline abt a weeek ago. Its very slow and applications open very slowly. I will be upgrading the RAm to maximum- 12 Gb by adding another Ram of 8GB. I also also add a SSD for optmal performance.

"
"

  The worst ever laptop I have ever seen in my life. I got this lap just for using gmail and ms excel. And it struggles to open even the mails and excel files. Such useless pics of tec from Lenovo. Never expected such a poor performing device that too from a renowned company like Lenovo.

"
"

  This Laptop Is Very Good. i think its better than Intel corei3 , must by Within 35k ,Overall good Laptop !

"
"

  Reviews said it's good and can play gta v, but I don't think so ,the speed of the laptop is not up to my expectations, little slow ,if you are able to go for Ryzen 5 that would be great idea I think

"
"

  It's pathetic .. very slow .. I bought is for my kid in 3rd grade .. even it's not solving this purpose.

   Honest review after a week.As seen in the video I posted laptop was laggy even with chorme and other low-resource intensive apps.It would hang if tried to open big games.Then I added 8gb of ram, and the laptop is now really smooth. Can play most games at 60fps at low-med settings and 40-60 fps at high settings.Multi-tasking is really smooth, not like before where 103% of ram was being by just using chrome.Pros:Keyboard is pretty good.Build quality is ok.Fan is pretty silent on idle works.Speakers sound kinda tinny but loud enough.Display is 1080p, and so it looks sharp.Cons:Display colours looks washed. (I did some tweaking with saturation, contrast and windows gamma correction, now I'm getting used to it).4gb ram is too low for this.I was planning to buy an SSD, but I'm doubting if I want to now.Overall after adding 8gb ram it's perfect for me, to play small games like Minecraft, Rocket league, Valo; and for media playback.

"
"

  Good for the price offered, even though it does not offer the latest features like 4K, as SSD etc.Games do not lag and good for daily productive tasks.

  I purchased this laptop and giving review after using it for almost a monthNo doubt the Laptop is very good with such a configuration but let me talk about the cons1.No Ethernet Port2. Both USB, Type C , HDMI all are at one side3. No Fingerprint Sensor or IR Camera for login using Windows Hello4. Most Important thing, you cannot install other Operating system in it. All you can do is create a Recovery pendrive and use it to reset your Windows 10 home to factory reset.

"
"

  Major selling point is 11th gen i5 with iris display, rest of the features are similar to any other available laptop. Got delivered on 1st dec on time, there is also an exchange option for old laptop available. Thanks to amazon. Overall great deal. Actual usage and issues will come out gradually. Giving 5 stars 👍🏻

"
"

  To all the people who were not able to scan the whatapp QRcode in their laptops. Pls uninstall the iris Xe graphics (without deleting the driver software for the device) and then reinstall it by clicking the ""scan for hardware changes "", so ur driver will be reinstalled as well as the Qrcode will now be able to help u access whatapp web in your laptop.NOTE:It's just a temporary solution, once you logout again the same situation arise,Maybe we have to wait for driver updation, till then if u don't logout from ur system things are set!*****************************************************APART FROM THAT, EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL SO FAR WITH THIS PRODUCT*****************************************************

  I bought the laptop from Amazon and I just have to say something is wrong with the laptop because it doesn't work properly and I just used it for a day. It's extremely slow, the apps don't work properly and stops responding and minute and it's causing me alot of trouble. I have called hp customer service and talked to the agent but they were not able to help either. The apps don't appear on the taskbar after starting the laptop, it takes them more than a minute to come. And the audio also stops anytime. And when the last time I tried opening it, the system said the pin is not working and told me to install a app for the same. I have also called a technician from Amazon and they'll look into it but I just have to say that I didn't expect this from hp. It is causing great inconvenience to me.

"
"

  Its very smart

"
"

  Pathetic service from Amazon. My invoice serial number and laptop service don't match and it has been 9 days and this has not been resolved. Please be careful. Also the warranty has already been activated when I got this.

"
"

  This is a very good laptop. Got product on time. Speed is very fast. Boot time is 3-4 secs. Only issue I am facing is with graphics. WhatsApp web is not able to scan QR code generated on this laptop screen. Though I tried whatsApp web using other laptop and with same phone it worked. So it seems, there is some issue with graphics of this laptop

"
"

  Waste of money...dont choose this product,when i want to return this product amazon is not directly accepting for retun and they were connecting to manfacture technicanFinally dont invest money on this product through amazonLot of fan sound and laptop body is not good

"
"

  Very much dissapointed by the laptopThe keys started coming out of its place .I have purchased this laptop on 31st dec 2020 and in just a span of week the key disappointed a lot 😕

"
"

  The laptop has major software issues from day1. HP customer care wasted 5 days, trying to resolve the issue thru remote control...but failed. And now Amazon doesnt want to replace, giving excuses. ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC SERVICE

   Configuration and price this Laptop is good choice.But I received the faulty Laptop its screen was continuous flickering. Though I thanks Amazon, very next day they scheduled the person and Laptop went for refund(since for replacement was not possible with seller). If you take this laptop then I suggest to purchase 1 year ADP and 2 year extended warranty will cost extra 7k.

"
"

  The product lives up to its description. The manifestation of so exalting a description is as immaculate as what you feel when you operate it. I am mesmerized by as much of its design as its functionality.

"
"

  Sad stroy with amazon ! I am regular customer i use to take small products , but unfortunately planned new laptop worth of 52,000 INR ,but i got defective proudct and they replaced agin after 2days but second time also got defective and perfomance issue and may be manufacture issue also and i have informed to csutomer service , they are not taking my complaint .pls let me know how to go for escalation on services ..really i didn't from amazon

"
"

  Buying this model is waste of money. Always lags, delays, slow slow performance. Laptop not responding after bootup. Bootup time keep on increasing every time it boots.Don't buy hp laptop

"
"

  Bad product ... track pad is producing annoying sound and rinsing sound while full volume!

"
"

  The laptop is good. Have been using it for a day and things work as expected. Purchased it for 55k. Unfortunately I had a bad experience with the seller for this item. I don't think anyone properly checks what he is dispatching. The laptop that arrived was already used. Packing of latop and charger were all over the place. Dirty fingerprints all over the laptop. Switched the laptop ON and it said no Operating system installed, which was kind of funny. So it was basically a paperweight worth 55k.Amazon team was hepful to arrange a replacement. But the seller took his own sweet time of like 8-10 days to deliver the replacement laptop. And this is inspire of me being a Amazon Prime customer. In today's times, sitting without a working laptop is akin to doing nothing. So yes, had a lot of mental. Tension and pressure while the laptop was arriving. I had a not so good experience with the seller.

"
"

  After a week's usage.. It's fast, compact, light weight. The screen is very bright and vibrant. However it was causing bit of irritation to the eyes even when I had normal brightness. Except that it's a go to device.

"
"

  Though on the costlier side, the benefits of i5 negates it all. Amazon needs to ensure the package is sturdy. The tape on the side was tampered with and there were marks of sharp objects used on the backside resulting in holes in the cardboard box. Thankfully nothing happened to the laptop inside.

"
"

  Super Bad Graphics!!!!!!!!!It's only 3 days old right now and already RAM is 70% used

"
"

  Speed in great due to SSD. Sleek and  light weight.Packing: The hp package was great. Amazon only added a cartoon around it without any safety material.Note: This laptop only have 512 GB SSD without any additional HDD.

"
"

  The laptop looks very classy. without compromising with the performance. Boot-up speed, read-write operations are super quick thanks to 512 GB SSD !!The display is impressive as well, with backlit keyboard always an add-on.Overall, the laptop serves the purpose for day-to-day programming, business/personal tasks. 11th gen i5 processor performs well for heavy programming and light video/image photoshop.

"
"

  Worest product from HP. It's very slow and now it's stopped working. I purchased this 2 weeks back and now it's not working. Please dont buy this product and don't waste your money.

"
"

  The brand new Laptop did not recognize the external hard disc drive used to transfer data , which drive  which works perfectly well in existing older HP laptops. I have spent extensive amount of time with HP onlince support going component tests, checking various aspects in device manager etc- updating BIOS version , but problem remains unresolved, so seeking replacement

"
"

  Worth buying but have some problems like it takes nearly 5 mins to start and work, alexa won't response sometimes, battery back is is ok not soo good it stays around 5 hours in we r in meet and nearly 4 hrs when we play movies.Rest all fyn runs fast after 5 mins after switching on. We can pay 50k for this with this problem not more.

"
"

  Never buy hp laptop. Very bad service bought the laptop 15 days back and started facing problem in mother board and inspite of having the warranty period I had to pay for the mother board but till now my laptop is not repaired inspite of payingNever ever will go for hp product very pathetic service

"
"

  It's stylish and sleek. Light weight. Excellent product for the price. Charging cable is short, but that's not a problem.

"
"

  The item was received on 25/01/2021 . but its warranty card was not provided in the packing.in this regard kindly provide its warranty card to the delivered address at the earliest. Also furnish the  address of the service Centre nearby.Request to do the needful

"
"

  Dummy laptop...camera no clarity.... system problem...speakers daggara fan air sounds vastunnay.... don't buy guys

"
"

  My first day of use......Most of the people were complaining about whatsapp login.You can see the result..There is no issue after updation

"
"

  Heavy fan speed, not really sure if this is problem with this particular product

"
"

  you can go for it . it is definitely a good choice under hp laptops . the battery is not very long lasting but if you charge it fully you can use it for like 4-5 hours . and overall display is good ,lookwise it is amazing it looks sharp and is totally worth it .

"
"

  Fan noise is too loudBoot time is almost 2minutesBattery performance is not so goodWorst  laptop don't go for it

"
"

  Having some issues related to battery life, working only 4 hrs maximum. Producing too loud fan sound. Unable to start it at times.

"
"

  Nice laptop with high-end configuration.Light weight, better battery life. Ms office with life time validity. Got it at 54450/-

"
"

  Well balanced laptop with i5 11 gen and 512gb ssd. It has got the latest Intel Iris XE gpu which is a plus point.

"
"

  Received damaged product for first display problem second time fan problem for brand new product not excepted this from Amazon

"

  It's working slow. fault is also thier

"
"

  The laptop got virus very soon without downloading anything.

"
"

  Stylish looks, slim size, light weight, quick rebooting in just 4 seconds. Overall it's a product worth it's price.

"
"

  Extremely slow and sluggish laptop. Very strange that its performance is such, with a high Technical Configuration. Not recommended at all.

"
"

  A good laptop. It is HP original. HP store also offers a free laptop bag along with the product but it was out of stock there.

  The processor is good battery backup is good picture quality is amazing,but the camera is not too good company claims 720p but it is not. It charge very fast, i dont like the plastic body metal body will last long.

"
"

  I brought this from local shop,  to say this is the best thanks to the new feature of intel core i5 11th generation 10nm technology featuring intel core i5 11th gen 1157 processor with base frequency of 2.40ghz & turbo boost upto 4.2 ghz and 512gb ssd, boot times are less than 10 sec ..go Go for it... fastest performance with battery life lasting upto 12 hrs ...

"
"

  Awesome product, HP launched it's Intel core i5 with 11th generation lap which is started sale from Nov 2020, FHD screen which is fabulous when comparing to other laps, invented iris graphics also, very speed processor which supports 5g net too, Backlit keyboard is superb, stylish model and keyboard is very smooth when working.

"
"

  Am giving 3 stars because am still confused after reading specifications of laptop and reviews on it. Should have been clear now but NO. Still confused! Not done! And also am very confused because I don't have money to buy it. I think I need help amazon!!!

"
"

  Simply great product.. Intel's 11th gen is awesome ..super performance and battery life too. Simply go for it.....battery life ia so good.

"
"

  I am using this laptop for 1 week now and i am not at all statisfied by the performance of this laptop. Despite of having great configuration on paper this laptop fails to perform in real. There are time delay in opening of apps and during web browsing web page stucks in between. In sum NOT RECOMMENDED TO BUY, I wasted my hard earned money on this product, please avoid wasting your hard earned money on this product.

"
"

  PROS :Good Laptop in low price compared with other companies. Processor is good and charm. Silver finish makes the laptop to shine. Its very light weighted too.CONS: It equipped with HDD only. So upadted W10 lags in high end gaming and multitasking.  So need to asd SSD.  RAM equipped with 2666MHz one. If u update with 3200 then it ll work in lightning fast

"
"

  Likes: 1 Build quality and designing and overall experienceDislikes:2 It's not value for money laptop.If you spend 61k ,you will get better specifications with asus and acer with i5 11th gen laptopBattery backup should have been better slightly.I got 4 hrs backup while watching you tube video or streaming prime videos ....41 watt hour battery it has ,it should be 50 watt hour atleast

"
"

  Spec are decent however the build quality is pretty cheap. WhatsApp qr works on chrome holding for a few minutes or re-trying it. Fiber quality is pretty low. The flap is loose.

"
"

  No doubt this laptop is fast but there is a misinformation in the descriptionThere is no RJ45 port in this laptopNeed to buy a type c to RJ45 adapter

"
"

  It's light weight, worth of the money, easy to use & carry to anywhere .  I found a little bit of heat issue!

"

  When I tried to register on Lenovo website it said the product is already registered and I have just 8 months of warranty remaining, basically it's a used product, used for at least 4 months.Pros:1. Good battery life, 6-8 hours2. Full laptop experience in small size3. The internal GPU, Intel UHD 600, is good enough to decode 4k@60fps, but somehow the browsers don't use it properly (may be windows issues or the drivers), downloaded files play smoothly in VLC, but browser can't handle 4k (there are frame drops)4. You get keyboard and active pen in the boxCons:1. Not anti glare screen2. It's 1280x800 screen, not FHD3. Without keyboard attached you can't use USB, as both USBs are in the keyboard4. Even without keyboard it feels heavy5. Huge bezels6. No ethernet port7. No HDMI port8. The screen is a fingerprint magnet, you'll need a screen protectorOkayish cameras.It will take sometime to be used to the keyboard, it's small with low key travel.You can access the boot menu by pressing fn+f12.It is possible to run Linux but issues with screen orientation and touchscreen will give you hard time. I tried installing linux (Ubuntu and Manjaro) it booted and installed successfully, by default they boot in portrait mode, you can rotate the screen from settings, but it doesn't rotate the touch, Manjaro sometimes caused black screen during screen rotation. Overall, you can install linux but you'll have hard time using the touchscreen.Buy if you want to do basic things like editing office files, browsing, watching videos. It's not made for gaming, video editing, programming etc.Update to windows 10 20H2 and use debloat scripts after that performance will be better.

"
"

  I bought it on 29th march 2021. But warranty start date is showing from  Nov 2020 and only 7 months are remaining now.Please rectify this issue.No issues with laptop. Really love it. Worth for the price.

"
"

  Smallest laptop I have ever seen. But, Thanks to the Tablet mode & Touch Screen.Battery Life 5 stars. Almost 12 - 13 hours.Sound 4 starsScreen 4 starsPerformance 4 starsStylus Pen - 5 starsKeyboard - 3 stars ( can be better)Camera 2 stars ( 2MP & 5MP Are outdated now)Charger - 3.5 stars (USB C type)Windows 10 - 4.5 stars (Genuine windows)MS Office - 1 star , one month trial (should be free)Storage - out of 128 GB , only 84 GB is usableRam - 4 GB is good.

"
"

  Very nice for children for attending classes and learning. It comes with a lenovo active pen also. I have hooked it up with hdmi to tv. Great thing is it has bluetooth and 5ghz channel , works flawlessly for my needs.

"
"

  Faulty product. Keyboard and touchpad was not working. Even after request for return, nobody came to pickup laptop and refund is not initiated.

"
"

  Liked compact size.Traveling makes it easier.

"
"

  Sensor is not working properly

"
"

  Bad product

"
"

  The bezel of the screen is quite large that minimise the display. But the display is quite good with a 24bit. And the touch responsive is also good. I am disappointed with this as i cannot run Adobe Indesign with it. But the ms office responsive is very good. The battery life is also great. The keypad though needs time to adebt to our huge fingers. Over-all this product is a great replacement to the ms surface-pro.

"
"

  Price is pretty high, may be we can get this features with other laptops with suitable RAM and SSD features

The internal GPU, Intel UHD 600, is good enough to decode 4k@60fps, but somehow the browsers don't use it properly (may be windows issues or the drivers), downloaded files play smoothly in VLC, but browser can't handle 4k (there are frame drops)4. You get keyboard and active pen in the boxCons:1. Not anti glare screen2. It's 1280x800 screen, not FHD3. Without keyboard attached you can't use USB, as both USBs are in the keyboard4. Even without keyboard it feels heavy5. Huge bezels6. No ethernet port7. No HDMI port8. The screen is a fingerprint magnet, you'll need a screen protectorOkayish cameras.It will take sometime to be used to the keyboard, it's small with low key travel.You can access the boot menu by pressing fn+f12.It is possible to run Linux but issues with screen orientation and touchscreen will give you hard time. I tried installing linux (Ubuntu and Manjaro) it booted and installed successfully, by default they boot in portrait mode, you can rotate the screen from settings, but it doesn't rotate the touch, Manjaro sometimes caused black screen during screen rotation. Overall, you can install linux but you'll have hard time using the touchscreen.Buy if you want to do basic things like editing office files, browsing, watching videos. It's not made for gaming, video editing, programming etc.Update to windows 10 20H2 and use debloat scripts after that performance will be better.

  Very nice for children for attending classes and learning. It comes with a lenovo active pen also. I have hooked it up with hdmi to tv. Great thing is it has bluetooth and 5ghz channel , works flawlessly for my needs.

  Faulty product. Keyboard and touchpad was not working. Even after request for return, nobody came to pickup laptop and refund is not initiated.

  Liked compact size.Traveling makes it easier.

  Bad product

  The bezel of the screen is quite large that minimise the display. But the display is quite good with a 24bit. And the touch responsive is also good. I am disappointed with this as i cannot run Adobe Indesign with it. But the ms office responsive is very good. The battery life is also great. The keypad though needs time to adebt to our huge fingers. Over-all this product is a great replacement to the ms surface-pro.

  Price is pretty high, may be we can get this features with other laptops with suitable RAM and SSD features

  Fully satisfied with performance of the device. Using for last 1 year and no complaints about the device, based on the price level.

  NOTE:@ There's NO option to upgrade the RAM, it is FIXED !!!@ Storage used is SSD SATA 3 and NOT NVME, so speed will be limited to max 500mbps.@ There's NO SD card slot.@ Battery backup is max 6 hours. ( check the complete details below )I have being using this laptop for a complete week now and following are the observations,●● BUILT QUALITY ●●-------------------------➼  It has impressive built compared to the price and competitors in the segment.➼  Has Metal chassis and still is relatively light in weight.➼  Speakers has average output, nothing phenomenal.➼  Connectivity is disappointment as there's NO SD card slot, Type C port; RJ-45 jack is also absent, though I didn't felt any need for it in a week.➼  There's NO in-built webcam, which is bummer. You have to physical install it every time when needed, which also consumes 1 USB port unnecessarily.➼  Finally, it looks good, but having more color option, especially black would have being great.●● DISPLAY ●●------------------➼ Its a 14 inch FHD anti-glare LED display, which has decent viewing angles.➼ Colour production is above average.➼ Contrast is average.➼ Auto brightness adjustment and no control whatsoever.* Its not a touch screen (just a note)●● SYSTEM PERFORMANCE ●●------------------------------------➼ System speed is faster than conventional HDD devices, but its mediocre when compared to nvme devices, which is new normal in this segment.➼ Light to medium games runs smoothly. Heavy games like GTA V & NFS Heat, too run on low to medium graphics, but Thermals are always sky high. With these thermals, I don't think laptop will survive even a month.So in short, its NOT a proper gaming machine. You can enjoy the light games though. ➼ Video editing on Adobe premiere pro is seamless, office softwares works smoothly too. So you can use it for productivity, but absence of Numpad is felt every second when you are using it for productivity.➼ Its indeed a good device for media consumption like online movies,etc as well as locally stored movies and web browsing. I didn't faces any issues yet, but RAM consumption was constantly in the range of 70-80%.➼ Finally touchpad is smooth and support multi gestures, which is in synonymous with windows 10.●● Battery backup ●●-------------------------# Charging takes less than 90 mins from 0 to 100 %# Supports Fast charge of 0 to 50 % in 30 mins.Following are backup data observed,➼ On 50% brightness (B) with web browsing is upto 5.5 hours.➼ On 50 B with editing or gaming is upto 4 hours.➼ On watching movies online at 50B is upto 5 to 5.5 hours.➼ On watching movies locally at 50-70B is upto  6  hours.●●●● VERDICT ●●●●------------------------This could have being the perfect laptop, but its NOT. It already has specs which are in the range of 50-60k machines like metal chassis, i5 10th gen processor, MX250 gpu, decent battery backup. But limitation on RAM upgrade and SSD SATA 3 type, are too significant to neglect.I will personally opt for laptop with NVME SSD and upgradable RAM, even if it doesn't have MX250 or metal chassis, as like any typical Indian consumer I will invests into laptop to retain it for least 2-3 years. And looking at the media consumption level and softwares evolving these days, 8GB RAM  and 600mbps SSD is certainly going to struggle in a year max.So if you have 48k at disposal and don't bother for higher system performance, and want a laptop for normal media consumption, then go ahead with this. But if you are like me, an typical Indian consumer which prefers performance in long run, then stay away from this. There are better alternatives to this like Asus vivobook 14, Lenovo Slim 3i, Acer swift 3, etc.Hope this help you make sound purchase decision.

  *Mac air 2017 to mi notebook 14! Why? *1. Same awesome build quality with extra HDMI port.2. MS office 2019 professional downloaded for free from youtube. It works awesome. In MAC, windows things doesn't work properly and also pandrive/external drive issues while transferring from windows/Mac.3.Display is just top notch in comparison to mac17. Also the bezel less display made the 14 inch screen fit into same 13 inch space of Mac.4. Windows games. Yes this mx250 2gb graphic card can handle gaming not the big idiotic ones but the one we professionals play while doing work. Like asphalt 8,9, fifa 14-16, GTA 5 and other small games too without affecting the 8gb ram.5. Keyboard is feel good and comparable to mac. touch pad is precise but could have been better build but no complaints.6. Sound is not good but mi provided dts audio processing app which makes it comparable to mac.7. It has so many modes battery saver to performance. Battery charge in 50 mins and battery consumption is comparable to MacBook.8. Biggest i5 10 gen is snappier way faster, smoother and battery efficient.Overall better than Mac air 17

  Best battery life and also performance!1 month review :  Not made for gamers ✔️  Performance is good ✔️  Battery life is good also charging time is less than 80 minutes ✔️  Practically build quality is best but trackpad is little cheap ✔️  I am using a additional keyboard and mouse combo for this ✔️  I am using Eclipse IDE in this and running smoothly and lag free experience ✔️  In this price this laptop is providing you a good processor and battery life ✔️  Storage is SSD type which is faster than HDD✔️  Display is pretty awesome ✔️  Cons :  Keyboard is not backlit ✖️  Graphics Card is not so much capable for heavy softwares like blinder, autocad etc✖️  Ram is not upgradable ✖️  Storage space is limited ✖️  Type c port, Rj45, sd card slot, is absent ✖️Overall Conclusion :1. Do not buy it for gaming and heavy softwares2. This laptop gives you a really good battery life of 6-7 hours.3. Performance is good enough.🔘 If you want a laptop for better battery and good performance and your budget is around 48k than you can go for it.

  The booting time is 10 sec.It's very handy andIt get full charge in 2 hours which is very fast because of the fast charger.Sound is gentle.The only drawback I face is backlit keyboard which you don't get at this price.

  Update after 10 weeks:====Spilled full glass of sprite on the keyboard. BIOS stopped recognizing the HDD. Took it to MI service center immediately. Engineer cleaned things up and said he will check later as he wanted all parts to fully dry.And they don't have all parts since this is a new product. They procured some parts to see which one was the problem, but by the time parts arrived (1 week), the service engineer cleaned up the laptop inside and kept it aside. And magically, everything started to work again.Not sure if I was lucky, or the laptop is somewhat liquid resistant. I am still happy with the solid build quality. Except for the missing built-in webcam, rest everything I got used to. Don't see them as problems anymore.Update after 2 weeks:========Weak speakers. No webcam is a deal breaker. Much harder to manage with external webcam than I imagined.If you are buying this, assuming you don't have issue with chinese products, the other option is honor magic book. Better bang for the buck. webcam, fingerprint reader and usb-c charging.If you are playing safe, and want to have peace of mind for after sales service etc, go for HP/Lenovo/Dell/Asus. Asus has a vivobook 14 in this price range, and it has webcam, fingerprint reader and backlit keyboard. Both Honor and Mi are new entrants to notebook space in India and not sure what will be their support story 2-3 years from now.=========Like:1) Unibody metal build quality. Feels sturdy in hand compared to similarly priced laptops2) Fast startup, SSD, i5 10th gen, and 8GB ram helps.3) Bright HD Screen4) Battery life and fast charging5) Value for moneyDislike:1) RAM not upgradable2) External webcam3) No backlit keyboard4) Trackpad feels cheap5) Laptop body gets scratched easily6) No USB-C port(for charging and docking)Not sure:1) Mi after sales support2) Repair costs if something goes wrong with laptop

  I wanted fast and light laptop and this is best laptop I could find in this price.There isn't back lit keyboard or finger touch unlock but I knew that when I bought this. If you have other Mi devices you can connect with it. I have Mi band and on connecting it with the laptop, I don't have to enter password to unlock it which was best feature and it balanced lack of finger touch unlock for me.Laptop opens in seconds and best thing battery last for more than 15 hours. I'm a blogger and my usage is lot more.  I don't shut down laptop whenever I'm not using it, I just lock screen and still it lasts full day for me and only have to charge once a day. It gets fully charged in an hour.Screen is awesome. Some said it is too bright for night time but if you turn on reading mode it wouldn't bother much.I'm using it for 2 weeks and so far I love the experience.

  This laptop has a very impressive look. I received this item 2 days before. Since then this item is running good. i'm sharing somethings about this laptop( purely my opinion ) :pros:1) DISPLAY: The quality of it's screen is very very very good. the resolution of the screen is so high that you can really enjoy your movies & videos at 4K quality. This laptop comes with an ANTI GLARE DISPLAY and I think this anti glare display with that type of high resolution is the most impressive thing in this price range.2) BATTERY: Now what to say about its battery! just one thing to say for its battery - AMAZING. It can easily run 6-8 hours based on your using.3) PERFORMENCE: If you are a student or someone who use laptops for light work and light gaming then this laptop is just made for you. It really gives a smooth performance .4) AUDIO QUALITY: Fabulous, Amazing, Wonderful …. don't worry about it's sound system. it is best in this price range.5) CHARGING SPEED: It don't take a long time to be charged. it is quite fast in my laptop< 0-60 percent in 48 minutes>6) DESIGN: DESIGN OF THIS LAPTOP IS COMPATABLE WITH MAC BOOK. So just awesome.7) TOUCHPAD: This is very good in my laptop. I'm feeling more comfortable with this touchpad than mouse. but I would recommend to keep a wireless mouse with you if you are not familiar with touchpads.CONS:1) CAMERA: THE QUALITY IS NOT GOOD OF THIS CAMERA. You should buy a new webcam if you are a student and very much depended on online class.2) ABSENCE OF FINGER PRINT SENSOR: THIS ALSO QUITE DISSAPOINTED. IN THIS PRICE RANGE MI IS NOT OFFERING A FINGER PRINT SENSOR WITH ITS LAPTOP. You can get a finger print sensor on Honor MAGICBOOK 14.3) SATA SSD: It comes with sata ssd . It would be better if MI offered a PCLe SSD (NVMe SSD) .OVERALL VIEW: IT A VERY GOOD OPTION FOR STUDENTS AND LIGHT WORKING PERSONS. BEFORE USING THIS LAPTOP DON'T FORGOT TO INSTALL AN ANTIVIRUS. IT WILL HELP YOU TO PROTECT YOUR LAPTOP  FROM VIRUSES AND MALWARES. RUN YOUR LAPTOP ON BEST PERFORMENCE MODE, TURNING ON BATTERY SAVER MODE COULD MAKE PRESSURE ON YOUR CPU..... SO THATS ALL.  THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEW. I WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW AFTER ONE MONTH OF USING THIS LAPTOP. TILL THEN STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY.

  Purchased the i5-NvidiaMX250 + webcam bundle from Amazon for 50k. Don’t know why it has split the products into 2 when trying to review although it was a bundle purchase. Anyway, here’s a very detailed review after 1 week of usage.Best part about the laptop – the BUILD. It’s a stunning metal body silver build which is just awesome and looks premium. No MI badging on the front. It looks really neat and chic. I clearly remember seeing this in an MI store in 2017/18 and just loved the build so much back then. I asked the sales executive, how much does this cost? And he said “Sir, this is not for sale. In fact this is not available in India right now and it may not be available any time soon.” 3 years later, here we have it in the very same build and form. 😊Additional plus point- Only 1.5kg; although most of the sleek laptops these days come with a similar or ever lesser weight, this one is quite sleek and pretty easy to handle single-handedly. Edges all across are metal framed and just brilliant. Absolutely robust.PROS – Let’s talk about the pros first.- This is the cheapest spec and config (with SSD & Nvidia GPU) you can get in this price compared to what is there in market.  It’s actually some good pieces of hardware at this price.- The display is fabulous in terms of anti-glare. I sit under a bright white tube light and it really does not strain my eye. The rest is what you can expect from a normal FHD screen. Nothing special. Display does seem a little vivid though. White is white and appears true to the term.- NO bloatware. MI just has a couple of softwares from the MI stack installed and thankfully, there is not much extra unwanted stuff. So, you don’t have to kill all the extras from Task Manager.- Battery time is pretty good. I’m not really sure it can last twelve hours with multimedia and gaming, but from a work perspective, the battery goes really long. In my first stint for work (with many softwares open and low brightness), it went beyond 6 hours with no charging from 80-90%.- The charging is really quick. I haven’t really cross checked on what MI claims about fast charging, but the charging is really super quick. I found it faster than my i7 work laptop even when it was brand new. Would have to wait and watch as the battery degrades with time.- SSD – This is SATA SSD. SATA SSD by default is faster than the conventional SATA (HDD) by nearly 10 times and NVMe SSD claims to be faster than SATA SSD by nearly 4 times. However, trust me, in today’s world, YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED A SSD DRIVE. I can’t even think of working on a HDD drive. Trust me people, there is a massive difference. When I upgraded to SSD on my old laptop, it was like upgrading to 5th gear from 1st gear. NVMe SSD is faster, agreed, but even SATA SSD is not bad, although I feel, there is not much of a price difference, MI should have put in NVMe, but I’m not complaining. (The horizon versions of MI laptops have NVMe SSDs).  BUT SSD (instead of HDD) IS NEEDED. PERIOD.- NOT A HARDCORE GAMING Laptop – So don’t expect this to be a super clocked gaming laptop. Nowhere does MI mention that. It’s pretty ok for games on the default settings and this one has Nvidia MX250. Should be ok for average and part time gamers. Haven’t really tried heavy games though. Remember, gaming laptops are different in the way they are configured specially with the GPU, cooling, ventilation and processor speed.- Multimedia is decent. This has DTS sound which makes some difference to the sound output compared to conventional sound. You can configure it your way with the pre-installed DTS Audio Processing app. I really think it’s almost similar to DOLBY ATMOS. DTS uses a higher bit rate though.- 8 GB RAM is quite adequate for almost everything unless you are a hardcore gamer.- One thing that people don’t mention is the surface grip. It has 2 horizontal rubber strips at the base which really hold the laptop well in its place, even when you tilt the table a bit. Doesn’t slide easily even if the surface is slippery which is quite good.- Did not experience heating at all. With all possible office softwares loaded which are still heavy on CPU and RAM, there was not much heating even while charging. Movies, music did not cause heating. Even running a game like ASPHALT did not heat it that much, though only ran it for some time. Prolonged gaming will surely cause heating as is the case with all machines. But this has plenty of heat ventilation slots at the bottom.- Thankfully, there’s only 1 sticker on the laptop and that’s a small i5 sticker and it’s neat and silver in colour. I just hated it when laptops put so many stickers like processor, GPU, sound etc. on the wrist panel.- The keyboard keys are well spaced just like a 15.6” laptop. So, if you’re used to typing on a 15.6” laptop like me, you wouldn’t notice any difference. I have seen horrible key spacing in some 14” laptops, but this one is pretty good.- Touchpad feels good. Supports multi-finger touch.- Another plus is the hinge mechanism. I found it pretty sturdy and tough and does not vibrate at all when you pull up the hood and release it. Let’s see how it gets with age.CONS – Yes it has CONS as well- I just dont like the new setups where the power button is on the top right of the keypad. I am used to the DELETE button being there. So pressed the power button accidentally many times.- The RAM and GPU cannot be upgraded. The RAM is fixed at 8 GB and so is the GPU. You cannot upgrade these. In fact, I believe these are factory attached to the motherboard and are non-detachable.- Webcam comes separately. Quality of the webcam is average, but can you imagine in this day and age, a separate webcam and not an inbuilt one. The worst part is it occupies one USB slot and is corded. If you don’t use a webcam, good for you.- The speakers are at the bottom. This is absolutely ludicrous. There’s so much of space on the top. The volume on full 100% is just so average like the laptops that were available 10+ years ago. Only the person sitting in front of the laptop can hear from the laptop speakers even in full volume. This is a disappointment, although I use earphones most of the times. Had the speakers been on top or sides, volume output would have been better.- The UP-DOWN keys are very important for all activities and they are really cramped on this keypad. MI should have configured these as full buttons, but most 14” have it similar.Other things worth mentioning- No Ethernet port, only 3 USD pots, 1 audio jack and 1 HDMI port- NO TYPE C / Thunderbolt port. NO SD Card reader port either TYPE C is there on the I7 version, but not there here.- No DVD drive or any optical drive.- The SSD somehow seems slower than expected when copying or writing. Could be a temporary thing.- The 30 day MS Office 365 trial is such a nothing. Microsoft themselves offer a 30 day trial for 365. Just that it’s installed on the machine.- USB 3.0 HDD with USB 3.0 cable with USB 3.0 port - file transfer to laptop seemed slower than expected. Again, could be a temporary thing.- The charging light is on the other side of the power cable slot.- NO backlight. Keypad has only 2 LEDs – one for the power button and one for CAPS LOCK.- Even with nothing open and all the extras shut, 4 GB RAM is consumed. :S- There are a couple of MI apps for instant wake up and fast data transfer with android phone. Haven’t tried those.CONCLUSION- If you want pure looks and a decent hardware, go for it. Looks are top class. Runs equally well. Plastic to metal is a big-big feel good factor and it’s really thin.- If you are hardcore gamer, DO NOT BOTHER about this one. It’s not for you.- Even average and part time gamers can consider this.- If you are anything other than a hardcode gamer, there is no reason to look for a competitor at this price. It is the cheapest in its segment. The base processor speed at 1.6 Ghz, Nvidia MX250, 512 GB SSD, 8 GB RAM are quite a configuration.- The battery life is awesome for WORK and multimedia.- Also, the RAM is not upgradeable, but honestly, have you really ever worked on something more than 8 GB? My office laptop is 16GB, but I just don’t find any difference in performance with respect to RAM.- MI Customer service has really improved over the years. However, answering you queries on phone is a different thing than getting your machine repaired. I’ve heard it takes time at the service centre. And anything classified by them as “damage”, has to be paid by you.PS: I have only used i5 laptops and higherGood luck with your purchase..

I have Mi band and on connecting it with the laptop, I don't have to enter password to unlock it which was best feature and it balanced lack of finger touch unlock for me.Laptop opens in seconds and best thing battery last for more than 15 hours. I'm a blogger and my usage is lot more.  I don't shut down laptop whenever I'm not using it, I just lock screen and still it lasts full day for me and only have to charge once a day. It gets fully charged in an hour.Screen is awesome. Some said it is too bright for night time but if you turn on reading mode it wouldn't bother much.I'm using it for 2 weeks and so far I love the experience.

  This laptop has a very impressive look. I received this item 2 days before. Since then this item is running good. i'm sharing somethings about this laptop( purely my opinion ) :pros:1) DISPLAY: The quality of it's screen is very very very good. the resolution of the screen is so high that you can really enjoy your movies & videos at 4K quality. This laptop comes with an ANTI GLARE DISPLAY and I think this anti glare display with that type of high resolution is the most impressive thing in this price range.2) BATTERY: Now what to say about its battery! just one thing to say for its battery - AMAZING. It can easily run 6-8 hours based on your using.3) PERFORMENCE: If you are a student or someone who use laptops for light work and light gaming then this laptop is just made for you. It really gives a smooth performance .4) AUDIO QUALITY: Fabulous, Amazing, Wonderful …. don't worry about it's sound system. it is best in this price range.5) CHARGING SPEED: It don't take a long time to be charged. it is quite fast in my laptop< 0-60 percent in 48 minutes>6) DESIGN: DESIGN OF THIS LAPTOP IS COMPATABLE WITH MAC BOOK. So just awesome.7) TOUCHPAD: This is very good in my laptop. I'm feeling more comfortable with this touchpad than mouse. but I would recommend to keep a wireless mouse with you if you are not familiar with touchpads.CONS:1) CAMERA: THE QUALITY IS NOT GOOD OF THIS CAMERA. You should buy a new webcam if you are a student and very much depended on online class.2) ABSENCE OF FINGER PRINT SENSOR: THIS ALSO QUITE DISSAPOINTED. IN THIS PRICE RANGE MI IS NOT OFFERING A FINGER PRINT SENSOR WITH ITS LAPTOP. You can get a finger print sensor on Honor MAGICBOOK 14.3) SATA SSD: It comes with sata ssd . It would be better if MI offered a PCLe SSD (NVMe SSD) .OVERALL VIEW: IT A VERY GOOD OPTION FOR STUDENTS AND LIGHT WORKING PERSONS. BEFORE USING THIS LAPTOP DON'T FORGOT TO INSTALL AN ANTIVIRUS. IT WILL HELP YOU TO PROTECT YOUR LAPTOP  FROM VIRUSES AND MALWARES. RUN YOUR LAPTOP ON BEST PERFORMENCE MODE, TURNING ON BATTERY SAVER MODE COULD MAKE PRESSURE ON YOUR CPU..... SO THATS ALL.  THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEW. I WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW AFTER ONE MONTH OF USING THIS LAPTOP. TILL THEN STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY.

  Purchased the i5-NvidiaMX250 + webcam bundle from Amazon for 50k. Don’t know why it has split the products into 2 when trying to review although it was a bundle purchase. Anyway, here’s a very detailed review after 1 week of usage.Best part about the laptop – the BUILD. It’s a stunning metal body silver build which is just awesome and looks premium. No MI badging on the front. It looks really neat and chic. I clearly remember seeing this in an MI store in 2017/18 and just loved the build so much back then. I asked the sales executive, how much does this cost? And he said “Sir, this is not for sale. In fact this is not available in India right now and it may not be available any time soon.” 3 years later, here we have it in the very same build and form. 😊Additional plus point- Only 1.5kg; although most of the sleek laptops these days come with a similar or ever lesser weight, this one is quite sleek and pretty easy to handle single-handedly. Edges all across are metal framed and just brilliant. Absolutely robust.PROS – Let’s talk about the pros first.- This is the cheapest spec and config (with SSD & Nvidia GPU) you can get in this price compared to what is there in market.  It’s actually some good pieces of hardware at this price.- The display is fabulous in terms of anti-glare. I sit under a bright white tube light and it really does not strain my eye. The rest is what you can expect from a normal FHD screen. Nothing special. Display does seem a little vivid though. White is white and appears true to the term.- NO bloatware. MI just has a couple of softwares from the MI stack installed and thankfully, there is not much extra unwanted stuff. So, you don’t have to kill all the extras from Task Manager.- Battery time is pretty good. I’m not really sure it can last twelve hours with multimedia and gaming, but from a work perspective, the battery goes really long. In my first stint for work (with many softwares open and low brightness), it went beyond 6 hours with no charging from 80-90%.- The charging is really quick. I haven’t really cross checked on what MI claims about fast charging, but the charging is really super quick. I found it faster than my i7 work laptop even when it was brand new. Would have to wait and watch as the battery degrades with time.- SSD – This is SATA SSD. SATA SSD by default is faster than the conventional SATA (HDD) by nearly 10 times and NVMe SSD claims to be faster than SATA SSD by nearly 4 times. However, trust me, in today’s world, YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED A SSD DRIVE. I can’t even think of working on a HDD drive. Trust me people, there is a massive difference. When I upgraded to SSD on my old laptop, it was like upgrading to 5th gear from 1st gear. NVMe SSD is faster, agreed, but even SATA SSD is not bad, although I feel, there is not much of a price difference, MI should have put in NVMe, but I’m not complaining. (The horizon versions of MI laptops have NVMe SSDs).  BUT SSD (instead of HDD) IS NEEDED. PERIOD.- NOT A HARDCORE GAMING Laptop – So don’t expect this to be a super clocked gaming laptop. Nowhere does MI mention that. It’s pretty ok for games on the default settings and this one has Nvidia MX250. Should be ok for average and part time gamers. Haven’t really tried heavy games though. Remember, gaming laptops are different in the way they are configured specially with the GPU, cooling, ventilation and processor speed.- Multimedia is decent. This has DTS sound which makes some difference to the sound output compared to conventional sound. You can configure it your way with the pre-installed DTS Audio Processing app. I really think it’s almost similar to DOLBY ATMOS. DTS uses a higher bit rate though.- 8 GB RAM is quite adequate for almost everything unless you are a hardcore gamer.- One thing that people don’t mention is the surface grip. It has 2 horizontal rubber strips at the base which really hold the laptop well in its place, even when you tilt the table a bit. Doesn’t slide easily even if the surface is slippery which is quite good.- Did not experience heating at all. With all possible office softwares loaded which are still heavy on CPU and RAM, there was not much heating even while charging. Movies, music did not cause heating. Even running a game like ASPHALT did not heat it that much, though only ran it for some time. Prolonged gaming will surely cause heating as is the case with all machines. But this has plenty of heat ventilation slots at the bottom.- Thankfully, there’s only 1 sticker on the laptop and that’s a small i5 sticker and it’s neat and silver in colour. I just hated it when laptops put so many stickers like processor, GPU, sound etc. on the wrist panel.- The keyboard keys are well spaced just like a 15.6” laptop. So, if you’re used to typing on a 15.6” laptop like me, you wouldn’t notice any difference. I have seen horrible key spacing in some 14” laptops, but this one is pretty good.- Touchpad feels good. Supports multi-finger touch.- Another plus is the hinge mechanism. I found it pretty sturdy and tough and does not vibrate at all when you pull up the hood and release it. Let’s see how it gets with age.CONS – Yes it has CONS as well- I just dont like the new setups where the power button is on the top right of the keypad. I am used to the DELETE button being there. So pressed the power button accidentally many times.- The RAM and GPU cannot be upgraded. The RAM is fixed at 8 GB and so is the GPU. You cannot upgrade these. In fact, I believe these are factory attached to the motherboard and are non-detachable.- Webcam comes separately. Quality of the webcam is average, but can you imagine in this day and age, a separate webcam and not an inbuilt one. The worst part is it occupies one USB slot and is corded. If you don’t use a webcam, good for you.- The speakers are at the bottom. This is absolutely ludicrous. There’s so much of space on the top. The volume on full 100% is just so average like the laptops that were available 10+ years ago. Only the person sitting in front of the laptop can hear from the laptop speakers even in full volume. This is a disappointment, although I use earphones most of the times. Had the speakers been on top or sides, volume output would have been better.- The UP-DOWN keys are very important for all activities and they are really cramped on this keypad. MI should have configured these as full buttons, but most 14” have it similar.Other things worth mentioning- No Ethernet port, only 3 USD pots, 1 audio jack and 1 HDMI port- NO TYPE C / Thunderbolt port. NO SD Card reader port either TYPE C is there on the I7 version, but not there here.- No DVD drive or any optical drive.- The SSD somehow seems slower than expected when copying or writing. Could be a temporary thing.- The 30 day MS Office 365 trial is such a nothing. Microsoft themselves offer a 30 day trial for 365. Just that it’s installed on the machine.- USB 3.0 HDD with USB 3.0 cable with USB 3.0 port - file transfer to laptop seemed slower than expected. Again, could be a temporary thing.- The charging light is on the other side of the power cable slot.- NO backlight. Keypad has only 2 LEDs – one for the power button and one for CAPS LOCK.- Even with nothing open and all the extras shut, 4 GB RAM is consumed. :S- There are a couple of MI apps for instant wake up and fast data transfer with android phone. Haven’t tried those.CONCLUSION- If you want pure looks and a decent hardware, go for it. Looks are top class. Runs equally well. Plastic to metal is a big-big feel good factor and it’s really thin.- If you are hardcore gamer, DO NOT BOTHER about this one. It’s not for you.- Even average and part time gamers can consider this.- If you are anything other than a hardcode gamer, there is no reason to look for a competitor at this price. It is the cheapest in its segment. The base processor speed at 1.6 Ghz, Nvidia MX250, 512 GB SSD, 8 GB RAM are quite a configuration.- The battery life is awesome for WORK and multimedia.- Also, the RAM is not upgradeable, but honestly, have you really ever worked on something more than 8 GB? My office laptop is 16GB, but I just don’t find any difference in performance with respect to RAM.- MI Customer service has really improved over the years. However, answering you queries on phone is a different thing than getting your machine repaired. I’ve heard it takes time at the service centre. And anything classified by them as “damage”, has to be paid by you.PS: I have only used i5 laptops and higherGood luck with your purchase..

  Good at this price range.Back light keyboard, finger print. Are missing

"

  The mi notebook 14 is the best one i got for that prize of 44 k , which have an i5 processor and 8 g ram with 2 gb graphics card and an 256gb sata ssd . The build quality was excellent and gave us a premium feel . The lap top looks exactly like an apple macbook . The best thing about this laptop is its display, which is best at this range .Its only take 5 seconds for boot up which is very fast . The keyboard travel was nice . Sound was not that much good but okay for that prize range . The very cons of this laptop is its web cam which is not good . The laptop was light weight and easy to carry . I have been using this laptop only for 2 days and its only a basic review from that two days usage .

"
"

  I'm having issues with my wifiIt disconnects automaticallyAnd the speed is half of what I get on my other laptop

"
"

  everything good

"
"

  The worst lap ever... I am not satisfied with this.. It doesn't support dual booting.... Touch pad doesn't support when linux OS is installed... Oh god.. Totally disappointed. Please try to improveBattery life was pretty good.There is no inbuilt camera... External camera was average.Perfect thickness.

"
"

  Has anyone else noticed yellow spots in the lower part of the display specially visible when display is black or while while turning on......got the same display problem even after replacing with a new one.So I am assuming every laptop has the same display flaw.Neverthless a nice product

"

  Hi there! Thanks for reading my review! Hope this helps, if you're gonna look for a laptop at a 40k budget. And this is a review, which is written after 2 months of usage. I ordered this lap on August 6, 2020, and got delivered by August 14, 2020.  The weird thing about the online purchase is the wait for the thing to get delivered. Ok, let me begin with the cons and then will jump into the pros.Most people here in the Amazon review section, complaining about there is no backlit for keyboard, no inbuilt webcam, no Type-C for charging/data transfer and no SD card reader. These cons won't bother you. So, I'm not considering these as cons in Mi Notebook 14. Apart from this, I noticed some brightness changes in display, when I'm at work. I thought this is might be part of an adaptive brightness setting. But I don't find any option to turn off in Display settings.And another difficulty, I found in this machine (I'm referring machine as Mi Notebook 14) is, when you charge this laptop without shutting it down (running background tasks) it heats up very quickly. I know we're charging this machine with a 65 W charging adapter. Maybe the heating issue while charging (without shutting it down) is because of this fast charging technology. But I don't like my lap is getting heated.At last, there is one more con, that I felt is, the hinge is not strong enough. When you're working under a ceiling fan or a high-speed fan the display vibrates back and forth. The change is clearly noticeable.Now we're jumping into pros.Highlights,* 10TH GEN CORE i5 chipset,* Punchy Display,* Packed with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD,* 65 W Fast Charging Technology,* 4 cell battery.Starting with Performance, you won't find any lag on this machine because of the latest processor from Intel and also packed with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD. The booting time is somewhere around 3 to 5 seconds. So, performance is top-notch.And talking about the display, the colours are vibrant and punchy. There are no issues on display, except the one which I was mentioned in the cons.Talking about the battery, the charging time is very less compared to other laptops in the market. I will mention battery stats in my usage. That is, it takes somewhere around 25 to 30 minutes to charge from 50 to 100%. This is not bad, right! And talking about battery life in my usage, my usage starts with a full charge. After two video calls ( each, one and a half an hour, that is totally 3 hours), 45% of battery still remained, which is also good. So you can expect an average of 5 to 6 hours of battery life.Finally, you're at the end of my review. So, think about the pros and cons which was mentioned above and go up with your decision. Hope this helps! Thank you!P.S. If you're considering this lap for coding, I will strongly recommend this lap to you, as I am doing coding tasks in this machine and I won't find any difficulty.

  Main problem is with volume of spiker is very slow I am not able to see movie in this in slow volume, and other problems is related with net speed also very slow.

"
"

  Every thing is ok ,but if you are a causal player this isn't good enough. And audio is weak in volume and range.

"
"

  Though we cannot upgrade ram and all I am very much satisfied with this product. 👌Mi

"
"

  Worst product in this price range

"
"

  Pls don't go for it. I am facing problem of the device turns off automatically. I can't understand why it is happening. It is just 60 days since I bought this notebook. Frustrating........

"
"

  The product is very good , switches on instantly everything is similar as promised , best laptop in this money range .

"
"

  Good laptop for day to day usage. You can expect 6-7 hours of battery life in normal usage. Performance is smooth with no heating observed in normal usage. Weight is also low so carrying it is no issue. Screen is decent. Overall satisfied.

"
"

  Laptop is very good and performance is also best. Only Microsoft office is not included in this. 1 month trail pack is given. So extra cost for microsoft office is for buyers. No RAM no SSD can be increase.

"
"

  So I have been using it for above a month. I needed a quick replacement and the specs for this seemed apt.Battery life: For office works, it last for about 5 hours. But I did not work continuously, so that's there. It's decent, nothing great.Performance: Super smooth and the 256 GB SSD makes things quite smooth. My job involves watching HD videos, and I was able to run multiple tabs on Google Chrome quite smoothly.Gaming: This is not a gaming laptop, but I did play quite a bit of Dark Souls 1 and a bit of GTA V. It was far from bad, and the performance was manageable considering you sacrifice on the graphics quality in settings.Thickness & design: Now to my favourite part about the laptop - the thickness and how it looks! I was in a dilemma between this and a good enough gaming laptop under 60k, but since I own two gaming consoles, I wanted a slick laptop, and this was the perfect choice! It's compact, looks gorgeous considering how slim it is and has no brand name on the front. So we could always fix us up some stickers like in a MacBook. It looks beautiful and classy! But the keyboard has no back-light.Overall, so far, so good. I do not plan to game on it, hence, hopefully it will last for a long time. It's a great buy for this price. Definitely recommend it over the Horizon Edition, as that does not justify its price like this (Standard Edition) does.

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  Trackpad issue ... Not working after some time. And don't go to service center for resolving the issue bcoz no one know their how to repair i was waiting for more thn 2 hours in service center. But the didn't repair it.

"
"

  Super products , Charing 9hrs with using internetNo heat problem, display super, performance super everything loved it

"
"

  Poor

"
"

  The first laptop received TURNED OFF while booting it up for the first time and it kept TURNING OFF. Wanted to return, but they offered only replacement. REPLACED laptop is working fine so far.SSD is not NVME. Its slow for that part.A detailed review is in youtube. Checkout the channel 'techntorq'

"
"

  Good specs at best price in the market. Using it for only 2 months, hence can't comment on reliability or after sales support from the company. Overall finish looks good, thickness & weight are OK. Battery life very good, getting about 5 hrs till now.But couldn't understand / didn't like why the camera is separate item, to be connected via a USB cable? Similar bezel size laptops from Lenovo have in-built camera, making it more compact. But here these are separate and cumbersome to use.

"
"

  no keypad light itnis basic thing

"
"

  Not great,worst quality got,very disappointed

"
"

  First of all as the headline says, stop thinking it is a low quality Chinese product, it really is not.Build quality:-really really light (not just saying that, it really is very light and prtable love that about this device).-it well built and is very sturdy.-display is 1080p IPS panel with good viewing angles and decently bright brightness levels.-Keyboard is also decent enough and have good travel. (does not have backlight keyboard.-Audio is also okay-ish nothing great but not a deal breaker also.Peformance:**this is not a gaming machine**-i did play celeste and farcry 2 on this device, celeste worked perfectly fine (low spec game) but farcry 2 was not really a very smooth experience yet the device on the integrated card ran the game at medium settings at 30fps so i would say maybe some older titles such as max payne 2 or vice city or indie titles could run smoothly but not new titles.-playing games like Farcry2 did overheat the system quite a bit, but usually 8-10tabs of chrome and sharekhan applications plus some music never stresses the machine.-BAttery life is also a plus point of this product, my screen on time with loud music+BLUETOOTH+ full brightness  was around 4-5 hours... which is great tbh.Verdict: See this is a really nice system with i5 processor that will let you do all of the productivity tasks such as word, excel, publisher, some light photo editing, netflix, youtube, etc. if you want anything more than that such as bitcoin mining or video editing or gaming, i would not suggest you this.Anybody looking to buy something for their parents or kids to study/work and maybe a little multimedia and ight games this is a really solid device. I bought this laptop for my mother as a gift to her and she really loves it. (portability and battery are the main points here)

"
"

  Superb, Fast, Sleek..

"

  Nice product

"

  I'll admit, I'm not the average user of laptops. My demands from it are low. I need it to boot quickly, run without significant lag and last for a long time without need for significant repair.I bought it 6 months ago, and at the time, all other laptop options under 50,000 simply sucked. There was nothing available with a processor that was not embarrassingly old or one that some brand wasn't trying to discount and liquidate stock. I would personally have preferred a Dell or Acer but most of them in this range were either i3 or old AMD or were renewed or were HDD.Mi met all these criteria. Using the webcam requires the use of a USB, but that's not a huge issue. Video quality is good.Screen quality is excellent. The laptop only comes with a trial version of Office, so you need to buy that separately or use another application.Sound quality is strictly OK. The speakers are located under the laptop so you need a hard surface if you want good output. I'd recommend a bluetooth device if you want better quality audio.It would have been good to have backlit keys, but I'd be happy if they don't come loose, at this price.The power button is also a key, so I'm concerned about how long it will hold up.The function keys functionality is reversed. So if you want to open help, it is Fn F1. Simply pressing f1 will mute your laptop.Overall, I am happy with the purchase. Let's hope it lasts.

"

  Good product ushing it from one month only drawback is the camera everytime we have to connect the web cam given by the laptop, otherwise the product is highly recommended

"
"

  Are you want to buy a new laptop with a small or medium budget I recommend MI notebook 14 8+256gb,intel ultra HD graphics cost 40000 rupees to 42000 rupees or it's another version e-learning edition.this lets you giving a high performance,screen,battery,keyboard,touch pad,high speed processor 10th generation intel i5 processor.Its only disadvantage is that we get only one month Ms office subscription,butWe can use Ms all softwares on office.com.if you like my suggestion & feedback mark as useful.Thank you for your attention.

"
"

  • Amazing Battery• Amazing Screen• Amazing Build Quality• Amazing SpecsI bet you to find a product with same configuration & build quality for the same price.

"
"

  The pros of this product are SSD, long lasting charge, light weight and metal body. The difference in join of screen to body is different from usual laptops increasing durability.

"
"

  No webcam and keyboard back light

"
"

  Build quality very good except trackpad,fast charging is good for this price range,battery good,. drawback are only backlit keyboard missing, inbuilt camera missing ,I bought for 45k is very good for this price range when you consider the RAM and processor

"
"

  Good performance. Only challenge is nowhere I see an embossed MI logo. It all stickers. Well it could so well be a local  product.Rest, while the camera is external, the features are fantastic.The laptop is light weight, boots quick and easy to work on.

"
"

  Laptop is very mediocre, better buy from companies known for making laptops. There is no inbuilt camera, external camera which comes with it is clumsy and of poor quality, defeats the purpose of Video conferencing and zoom.

"
"

  Not a original products, fake products coming be careful. i have brought this product. Lables and taps are removed damaged, when i inform to customer support, product damage only they accept. but who will confirm this is original product. why lables are removed. who removed?

"
"

  This laptop isn't stand upto the expectations that I had have after seeing the reviews on youtube about it. It hangs a lot. Not that much powerful.

"
"

  Worst product I'm telling you why.From date of purchasing the product can be working goodBut after 10 days it can automatically off &than i was trying to restart the lapy it goes on dead mode .In my opinion mi is new in this field ,company know about market he thinks we manufacture cheap products and people buying thats wrong .Quality also Matters.Thank you

"
"

  Overall performance is very good

"
"

"
"

  Battery life is excellent. Camera is ok.

"
"

  Good laptop for the price range. The USB camera is a definite negative especially for online classes as it affects the mobility. I am not a gamer, this is definitely good for normal usage.

"
"

  Not Upgrdable Ram.No 2 Ssd Slot.Display Light problem

"
"

  Every thing is good but only trackpad is of cheap quality

"
"

  I have bene using this since 3 weeks and the laptop is really fast. Totally loved the laptop. Worth the price

  My studies depend on this laptop mostly. Not used for gaming. The rubber stud under need to be more sticky.Just using for a week past.

"
"

  Excellent quality and performance at budget price.

"
"

"
"

  I would request buyers to kindly check the product before you buy. its a Laptop but you cant keep it on your lap bcoz your thighs will burn. the keypad becomes hot and even if you connect with Dell team they will say that its normal for the laptop to heat up. I bought this product from Croma Store Saket and i feel i wasted my money. please buy any other laptop but not Dell.
