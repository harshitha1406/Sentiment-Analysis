Well, as I started to setup this up, I realized that it was too slow. I gave it the benefit of doubt and shut it down for later use. when I setup it up, the battery was around 70%. At the end of the setup it as 60. Fine, I give it an hour and resume exploring it. I set the mode to battery saver and cleansed all the unnecessary apps, and downloaded chrome and acrobat. I want to use this laptop for light browsing, creating word documents, reading pdfs and watching movies in spare time. Thus far, it has now disappointed. The display is amazing  and one can feel the SSD in action- crisp and sharp. I have used macbook air and this doesnt disappoint. Also, the design is very catchy, inspired from Macbook and Yoga 360. The price was also decent. Well, I started a 60% battery, remember- it is 34 now. The battery sis the only concern I see. but otherwise this is awesome.

All of this due to 128GB m.2 ssd installed in it.Pros-1- IPS Display 9/102- SSD 9/103- 4-5hr battery backup 7/104- Design 8/105- Build quality 7/10Cons-1- 3.5hr of Charging time2- Charger Quality3- Sometimes mouse trackpad & keys are a bit unresponsive.Verdict- This laptop @13.5-15k price is 100% value for money.Although this laptop equipped with celeron processor but believe me it does what it is meant for. You can't expect a scooter to carry the loads of a Truck. Same goes here. This laptop is made for basic tasks and it does flawlessly. Hence it is a perfect budget choice for students, online classes, office works etc.If you are in Gaming & video editing work..then please don't buy this laptop. This laptop is not made for such tasks.Thanks.\\n\\n\",\n",
              " \"\\n\\n  So, I ordered this after reading the reviews of my predecessors. I can say I was not at all disappointed. I got this machine today and I am writing the review from this. Well, as I started to setup this up, I realized that it was too slow. I gave it the benefit of doubt and shut it down for later use. when I setup it up, the battery was around 70%. At the end of the setup it as 60. Fine, I give it an hour and resume exploring it. I set the mode to battery saver and cleansed all the unnecessary apps, and downloaded chrome and acrobat. I want to use this laptop for light browsing, creating word documents, reading pdfs and watching movies in spare time. Thus far, it has now disappointed. The display is amazing  and one can feel the SSD in action- crisp and sharp. I have used macbook air and this doesnt disappoint. Also, the design is very catchy, inspired from Macbook and Yoga 360. The price was also decent. Well, I started a 60% battery, remember- it is 34 now. The battery sis the only concern I see. but otherwise this is awesome. Zyada ungli mat karo- chup chap laptop kholo, normal use karo rakhdo. Zyada kalakari karne ki avashyakta nahi hai. If you expect that you can hack Iran's nuclear plant with this , then All the Best. Do not use it for heavy coding and games. Also the frame is decent ,not aluminum but plastic but I find it sturdy and ultra light. I will update this as I move with this machine.\\n\\n\",\n",

              " \"\\n\\n  Review after using for 4 days.Pro's -1) Performance - It can easily handle basic tasks such as browsing, MS office, watching movies & online class.2) Storge - Even though we juz get 128gb ssd storage(out of which 94gb is available to use), we can expand Storage using memory card slot. One thing i liked in this laptop is we can easily insert memory card without card reader juz like we do in mobile phone. I brought 128gb sd card & inserted in it. I am storing all my files in the sd card. Don't store any files in system storge (128gb ssd slot). It will slowdown the Performance of system.3) Display & Sound - Top class 👍4) 🔋- OkayishCons -1) Charger pin is very loose. I m worried about its durability2) Hinge - I am really worried about hinge. It's very loose. Hope it won't fall down. Avita should focus on this4) Keyboard & mouse pad are hard.3) Build quality - Actually i don't say this as con for the price i paid(13600rs). I am satisfied with plastic built quality for this price. We need to be careful & make sure that laptop won't fall down from height.Finally if you are looking for basic laptop for online classes, Watching movies, MS office, browsing & if you can handle laptop carefully. Then go for it.\\n\\n\",\n",
              " '\\n\\n  Game changer is 128GB SSD, boots windows in 15-20 seconds.Browsing websites, watching videos, working on online worksheets is faster.Even 10 different browsing windows works fine. More than that slows down the Laptop.Not much heating initially but after 2-3 hours of continuous usage bottom gets heated.Very thin and lightweight and medium sturdy, so not for heavy rough and tough usage.Keyboard is good. Touchpad position is awkward and size big, so people with bigger palms will accidently touch mouse touchpad when typing.Overall after a month of usage, found not much issues for general usage of browsing/meetings/videos watching. Not tried any games and any external apps as Windows is in S mode. But with browser all apps usable, like spreadsheet, document editing, youtube, etc.\\n\\n',\n",

              " '\\n\\n\\n  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Recent review- (earlier review can be found after recent)Since past couple or weeks I had observed mouse touch-pad issue. The movement of mouse is not as expected, it’s slow. I made all possible changes in settings but no use.It’s a bugger when I use MSPaint tool. While working in mspaint the mouse pointer suddenly jumps anywhere on the screen.(Attached video)I had registered complaint to Avita customer care about this and they attended in 2 days and the technician replaced entire touch pad along with keyboard. But still the problem was not resolved.I have again registered the complaint and will see what they do about it.Will keep you updated.....——————————-Below was the review I posted in first 4 days-——————————-A suggestion to laptop buyers is that before purchasing it, know what your own requirement is.I purchased this laptop for my son’s school activities like Online classes, video conferencing etc.Basic activities like MS Teams, MS Office, Browsing etc. can be done without any problems.As it comes with Windows 10 in S Mode, you have an option to disable it but I preferred not to, because its Secured mode and it helps to keep laptop safe from any Malware and saving you additional Antivirus cost.This laptop gives me battery backup of AT LEAST 4hrs with uninterrupted online class.Standby time would be definitely beyond that.Build quality is good according to its price. It costed me around 17k. I searched Amazon, Flipkart for budget laptops and this was the only one that deemed fit in my requirements.SSD really makes difference than conventional HDD. Its super fast, loads windows in seconds(depending on config).All ports are working fine. Please Note- This laptop DOES NOT have a Lan Port as it supports Bluetooth and Wifi only. As most of us are working on Wifi only, Lan port should not be an issue.Overall- I am satisfied with the laptop. I may change my review after couple of month’s usage if I see any difference in performance.\\n\\n',\n",

              " '\\n\\n  I was very apprehensive of buying this computer but I did not have the budget to go for i3 or i5 so I bought this. Oh man ! this is one heck of a laptop. You will be delighted to lay your hands on this laptop. The screen is top quality, similar in quality to that found on many top-end models.  It is not shiney but matte which you can use for long periods of time without problem. The keyboard is decent and comfortable. The touchpad may have been better, it does not have the finesse of higher end models. The body is made of plastic but looks stunningly good. Hope it does not start showing signs of wear for some time.  The size of the laptop is just perfect, light-weight and very comfortable to work on. Speakers are ok, acceptable at this price point, sound is loud enough. It has a front camera which is Ok in quality but it is placed in a very odd position (near the screen and keyboard joint) which makes it not suitable for most face to face chats.The speed of the laptop is very good. It boots in 10 s and shuts down in the same time. All applications such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Office run smoothly. It does not show any lag even when I open a lot of programs together. Battery life is decent, about 3-4 hours on a single charge.All ports are located on the back side, not on the sides as in other laptops but this is not much of inconvenience and I am hardly inconvenienced because of this.The nest this about this laptop is the top quality screen. The worst thing is the placement of camera and probably a little less than perfect track pad (but not too bad).\\n\\n',\n",
              " '\\n\\n  Since I have ps4 console, I bought this laptop only for office work, browsing and watching online stream videos.. If u need for basic use, go for it. This is not a gaming laptop.. I had Asus laptop previously and it sucks in performance and cost around 25k however i bought this laptop as exchange for 9k and the speed is awesome. Battery backup comes around 3hrs 30min if we watch videos. Normal use comes around 5hrs. Its very slim one weighing around 1.3kg only. Easy to carry not like my old asus(heavy one) and my office dell laptop(weighing around 2kg) Overall a good budget laptop Worth 9k for basic level.

              " \"\\n\\n  Below are my verdicts compared to the price I bought it (₹17,150)# Well built, nice looking, slim and light weight# Windows 10 built in, though in S mode, but S mode can be disabled with latest Windows updates# Decent performance for few light weight multi tasking, such as web surfing, playing songs via media player, documents editing, connecting to remote desktops. Dont expect any gaming performance from this humble device.# Keypad is nice, no backlit though# 2 USB ports, 1 HDMI# Screen display is really nice, nice resolution# Battery back up is fine. Depending on usage. I am getting in between 5 hours to 7 hours for very light weight use with battery saving mode enabled.# Camera quality is not upto the mark, could have been better# Mouse trackpad is nice, wide, intuitive# 4 Gig RAM serves the purpose# 120 GB SSD delivers good performance# Bottleneck is created by 2 vCPU Intel Celeron processors. But overall manages to deliver basic performance, CPU clocks upto 2.5 GHz when demand is High. L1 and L2 cache are on lower side, no L3 cache.# Speaker is loud enough, lacks the fineness / Quality, but does the job, you can watch YouTube, Movies, listen to songs..Overall, a nice well built laptop at this price with decent performance for basic activities, don't load it up with too many apps running in parallel, it will serve you well.Also, wait for offer price. It is a value for money product when bought at price around 17K, Not at its normal price which 19K\\n\\n\",\n",

There was a student offer - 3 years extended warranty + On-site service + Sony headphone with mic for Rs.1799. It's a very good deal. - Decent battery life of 3-4 hours of continuous use.Cons: - Screen resolution is not so great - Webcam quality is poor - In-built speaker quality is decent not loud enough. We are using it with a headphone. - Charger has a peculiar shape and design. - There a warranty date mismatch which was sorted out after talking to the customer care.Go for it, if you plan to buy this for kids or basic daily use.\\n\\n\",\n",

              " \"\\n\\n  Edit:The difference in performance after adding and booting from SSD drive is phenomenal! It feels like a completely new (much slicker) laptop now!Although, I realised all too late that the SSD slot on the laptop supports NVME type SSD (and not SATA). Choose what you buy carefully.Original Review:I've had this laptop for 9 months now and can confidently say it's woefully underpowered. I knew even at the time of buying that 4GB ram might be too less and that was apparent on the day I powered the laptop on. Booting took ages and everything worked at grandma speed.I upgraded the ram to 12GB the first week of operation itself which helped quite a bit. However, I've struggled to get anything important done on this laptop in the last 9 months of owning it. I mostly use it to watch Netflix or maybe light surfing on chrome.Recently figured that the HDD itself is also a bottleneck, and have now had to order a additional SSD to run the OS in. Hopefully that will solve it for me.Verdict : buy only if you're comfortable upgrading the laptop on your own or have access to a cheap repair shop. Total cost for me - 25K (laptop) + 2.5K (8GB RAM) + 3.5K (250GB M2 SSD) which I think is still much cheaper than buying an equivalent laptop directly.\\n\\n\",\n",
              " \"\\n\\n  I purchased this laptop for 24500 which is a total steal for this laptop. Ryzen 3 works fine, don't expect to run heavy applications or games on it. 4gig of Ram and 1Tb HDD is also great for the price. The screen is a total plus point, its an FHD screen, it's a VA panel I guess but for anyone, it's much much better than those 768p HD displays. It is sharp and great to look at. Not good with the viewing angles (obviously a VA panel), but it is good enough. The speaker is fine and the keyboard is also fine for me. The battery life also seems to be okay with about 3-4 hours of backup. Only get this laptop if you are a normal user that does browsing, watching movies and typing or for basic office use, do not expect more than that.What I would suggest is to increase the ram to 8 gigs and if you can, please replace the HDD with a 2.5 inch SSD. Just by doing these 2 things, it will run much more smoothly than you can even imagine.\\n\\n\",\n",

I bought this for college assignments (on social sciences). It was urgent for me to buy and the screen impressed me when I saw this laptop on videos. I had a lot of expection with the screen when it arrived but the Full HD, anti-glare technology screen is misleading; \"anti glare\" is just for the name\\'s sake, yes it doesn\\'t reflect so much of  light but it\\'s definitely is not \\'anti glare\\', it should have been named \"less glare\". Moreover, it\\'s side angle view is quite annoying at times, esp. if there are many people in a room watching movie in it. However it\\'s 15.6 inch display almost feels like a  standard desktop\\'s screen and has a resolution better than that of hp and acer laptops of this price range. So if you are a student looking a laptop for basic college works at low buget then this is the one for you but only if you are not angry with China because yes it\\'s made there. Haha. Happy shopping.\\n\\n',\n",

However, since day one i.e. June 09, 2020 the said product did not perform as required and we faced speed issue on number of occasions. It takes ample of time for any application to open. Due to these issues, my daughter was unable to concentrate in her studies and her performance was badly affected. She is mentally disturbed because of very slow performance of the said product.In the month of December 2020, I had called the customer care and I was informed to set-up the Lenovo diagnostic tool and scan the laptop on regular basis. I followed the instructions provided to me, however, the problem could not be fixed and my daughter continued to suffer hardships and mental harassment.Recently, I once again called the customer care and was forced to lodge a complaint on March 04, 2021. On a lot of back and forth with the customer care, I was informed that the said product will perform slow on Windows 10 and that I should use Windows 08 for the said product to perform properly. I was shocked and surprised with this information considering the fact that representation to purchase the said product on Amazon website in June 2020 was specifically with Windows 10 preloaded in the said product for Home Edition.When I told them to replace, they denied.\\n\\n',\n",

Below are the reasons :1. Comes With MS OfficeYou might see reviews starting they didn't receive the office package. That isn't true. Sometimes they wouldn't have found where it is.2. Super upgradable(if wanted for heavy tasks)You can expand its RAM up to a massive 20 GB and it has an additional M.2 NvMe SSD port. That's a boon.3. Immersive audio experienceDolby does makes the audio much better.4. Lenovo online SupportWell driver downloading isn't a problem now. The website detects your system and does it automatically (drivers excluded in Windows updates)5. Light GamingNot much I can ensure but you can play games like ones of Assassins creed family,most racing games and other stuffs in medium graphics.Rest you can find in the other reviews as well. So just didn't mention.The only con is the battery life.Standard - 5 hoursMulti tasking  - 4 and half hourGaming or other heavy tasks  - 3 hours.(avg.

              " \"\\n\\n  Great for daily home use. Mine came with 4GB of memory, which is bare-minimum now to support modern web browsing. Google’s Chrome browser consumes a lot of memory, so go for 8GB if you have the option. The CPU seems speedy enough. My one honest annoyance is that, like many laptops, the screen tint appears slightly more bluish—white skews slightly blue. I didn’t see this on my old MacBook Pro, so it may just be a Windows issue with the available color profiles. I mentioned home use, because the top of the lid scratches easily, so taking this on the road would likely induce scratching from rough handling. The thing which I didn't like at all is the battery life, Its battery life is very low i.e. after full charging it survives only for 2-2.5 hrs with continuous use.

Had my own tech guy check it out and it\\'s obvious that they are all old faulty products, refurbished and sent to customer with the hoax of an \"offer price\".

Multiple emails and DM\\'s later, they still won\\'t respond for a replacement. The laptop hangs and freezes everytime as users have mentioned here. It doesn\\'t want to connect to a WiFi connection and you always need to disable the adaptor every now and then. My suggestion, go for a Parle G laptop or a chor baazaar laptop, but stay away from Lenovo. I would even suggest Dell, but never Lenovo just for the fact that you would be paying full price for faulty and old products.

              " \"\\n\\n  Purchased this laptop on 29th October 2019.Writing a review after almost 1 year of usage. To start with this laptop is very quick to start when powered on, hardly takes 5 seconds to start up.Great for those with basic requirements like daily surfing, Watching movies, MS office, Excel, Powerpoint and basic editing tasks. Due to SSD it works like charm.Pros- SSD makes it pretty fast with 5-7 seconds boot and start time. (I checked higher end models in shops but could not find one that starts as quickly this)- Light weight, this is pretty light and easy to carry, my earlier samsung laptop used to weigh almost 2 kgs and this slim trim piece comes as a delight to me in terms of weight.- Great battery life, haven't found any problems with battery life till now. It works 6-8 hours on a single charge easily. For me it is on almost for the entire day and it still works great.- Great volume, I am yet to see a laptop with so crystal clear sound. Most laptops have very low volume.- Got windows 10 and MS office students version license with it which is great add-on at this price point. (many higher priced laptops also don't provide this).Cons- Well almost none for me considering my requirements but you can find difficulties with viewing angles and screen resolution while watching movies, but I have no complains for it at this price point.ConclusionA great value for money laptop at this price point, After one year I can say that I am pretty happy with the purchase.\\n\\n\",\n",

I needed anything at or beyond 256 GBThird requirement was latest generation of processor, 10th Gen in this caseFourth requirement that kind of became mandatory after I was doing the diligence was MS Office preinstalled. Again, why go for aftermarket installation. Note: lot of people complain that this is only for 30 days. That's not the case. I activated just by signing in and updating Office.The only other competition to this is Lenovo in similar price bracket, but it has a poor camera. With all the online classes and office, you can't look like crap just because you have a camera dating back to 2000s. All else are either expensive, do not have SSD, do not have 8 GB RAM or MS Office.The screen could have been better, but I have a 29 inch LG screen so no complaints.I missed checking if the swivel opens 180 degrees and this laptop doesn't open 180 degrees, so if you do use dual monitor then you have to place  adjacent to additional monitorVery satisfied till now. Boot time with SSD is awesome, the system boots in under 10 seconds.Although it says 1.47 kg it feels a tad heavier.

              " \"\\n\\n  Brilliant productMost of the configurations available in this price range (less than 40k) were either 4 GB RAM or 1 TB HDDMy base requirement was 8 GB RAM as Win 10 just doesn't work with 4 GB and going for aftermarket RAM on a new laptop did not make senseSecond requirement was SSD. I needed anything at or beyond 256 GBThird requirement was latest generation of processor, 10th Gen in this caseFourth requirement that kind of became mandatory after I was doing the diligence was MS Office preinstalled. Again, why go for aftermarket installation. Note: lot of people complain that this is only for 30 days. That's not the case. I activated just by signing in and updating Office.The only other competition to this is Lenovo in similar price bracket, but it has a poor camera. With all the online classes and office, you can't look like crap just because you have a camera dating back to 2000s. All else are either expensive, do not have SSD, do not have 8 GB RAM or MS Office.The screen could have been better, but I have a 29 inch LG screen so no complaints.I missed checking if the swivel opens 180 degrees and this laptop doesn't open 180 degrees, so if you do use dual monitor then you have to place  adjacent to additional monitorVery satisfied till now. Boot time with SSD is awesome, the system boots in under 10 seconds.Although it says 1.47 kg it feels a tad heavier.  I have been using Mac but that's twice the price.I wish there were more USB ports, it has 2 USB and 1 C typeThis is default choice in the specs/ requirements so best buy\\n\\n\",\n",

Here is the detailed review of the product..Battery backup is impressive. If you are not a heavy user it can last for a day. ( 9/10 )Performance wise it's a beast.. with 8GB of ram, i3 10th gen processor and SSD storage you will not face any problem related to speed and performance. Windows boots in just 6-7 seconds. The software or apps takes max of 3 seconds to load... I have not faced any lagging issue till now. ( just avoid high end softwares and games and your laptop will work like a charm ) (10/10 )Display is also good... I don't know why people are complaining about it. Also bezels are not too thick as in dell vostro and others. (8/10)Looks are also decent with patterned surface which feels amazing to fingers and also provides a good grip. (8/10)Sound is AWESOME! at 100% volume it feels like i am playing music over a Speaker... It is really loud. You'll have to keep volume at 40-50% for general use.You'll not get any other laptop with this sound quality at this price. Really! (10/10)Camera is Average or you can say good for video calling purposes... As you don't have to take selfies with it.So finally, This laptop is good in every feature. A power packed machine by HP. You will not get any other laptop with this type of performance, speed, sound and battery for this amazing price. Better than vivobook 14, vostro and ideapad series. Just Go For It!Overall rating 9/10.(you also get a lifetime version of MS Office 2019 home & student - powerpoint, word, excel & one note which comes preinstalled with it that is you just have to sign in with ms account in any of the application and you will unlock the office suit)Also a big thanks to Amazon.

Plastic feel was the only putoff, but you can't expect a metallic body at this price. Laptop doesn't feel very sturdy for the plastic body. Booting / Shutdown is very fast because of SSD. 8GB RAM is min required for decent Windows 10 performance. Screen resolution is good. Very lightweight so you will not mind it carrying around.

Im a college student casual user only for powerpoint and browsing only i decided to go for it .Basically i was using old model of hp laptop only with amd old processor which gave lot of problems i cannot able to use that for simple one. I searched compared with other laptop also .when i bought i purchased for 36k i dont know why price been increased while that time some of the model like asus laptop avita were good also they were not some thing to look like asus had 4gb ram and typically having hesitant to with amd ryzen processor.This laptop till now basically fine it will feel compact also microsoft office free version preinstalled that also major advantage there are some things to be look after like:- Only one time i faced lag or hang i dont know  why i had put my pen drive so due to that may be i faced other than that i didnt hang problem.-While update notification the laptop like flickering the screen blackish that i also faced twice after updating it will not come.-Also keyboard also it  good feel will not comfortable to type it will feel cheap feel quality but mousepad feels fine. it necessary to wireless keyboard .-while turning pressing power button for turning on the laptop i feel that i have to press 2 times for that i dont know why but boot time is like 3 seconds .These are all things that need to be considered although it is not a major con somehow have to check with that.Performance is decent normal use whilw i played wcc2 game that feels like hiccups happened anyhow it is a decent processor no heating problem or fan noise i didnt heard of till now.Another thing that everyone should after is that battery backup the battery capacity mentioned like 41 or 42whr so claiming less than 7hr majorily i also one of the reason i bought but decent battery backup only charging also take less than 2hrs last 5 percent takes time little battery backup at a stretch use u will less than 4 hrs only.Screen quality is hd only it is decent enough.FINAL VERDICT: Overall i suggest for buying this laptop mainly should be based on price only for 42k we can get better laptop also ig u get a price of 35 to 38k it will make much sense and value for money.Also mi laptop learing edition will be there still it is not that available there are not that much review i didnt go for it . other than it is only available above 40k better buy mi laptop with i5 gen or asus laptop mainly there will be i3 only it will be available Regard with amd processor in amd ryznen 3 or 5 are available in avita brand or some other company also but still not suggest only in case of heating or battery draining issue this with old experience of processor also review of other laptop only im saying.U can buy hp mi acer and asus with ssd option better value .Also thing this laptop im not sure about we cant add ram or expandable that thing need to check after in cas of mi laptop im sure that is not upragable.\\n\\n',\n",

I have worked on 14 inch screen and it becomes difficult for your eye to concentrate and your shoulder bends forward (rounded back posture) as keyboard layout will be small. If you go over 15.6 inch screen, it becomes problem for carrying the laptop. Another plus point of this laptop is, it is matt finish, so not much light reflection from the screen light tubelight/door or windows light.2. Keyboard layout, because the laptop is 15.6 inch, the keyboard layout is relaxed, there are enough space between keys, so you don't end up making too many typos and keep hitting backspace key all the time3. 256 GB SSD, instead of taking 1 TB HDD, I went for 256 SSD as it lighting fast to setup, start, shutdown computer, open files etc., I am super happy about this SSD.In earlier days we used to save movies and songs in laptop so we needed large space, but now Netflix, Prime videso you don't really need big hard drives, plus if you use OneDrive and Google drive you files are always with you and it is not tied to one computer/laptop, you can access it from any device.Out 256 GB around 160-180GB is available for your to use. If at some point in future we really need larger storage I can upgrade the 256GB SSD to 512 or 1TB SDD or in addition to 256 GB SDD, we can add 1 TB HDD. But I doubt that day will come for this laptop as it is primarily used by my kids for school work or light browsing by adults. Also we always have the option of saving files to USB pen drive4. 8GB RAM, when you open task manager you can see Windows OS takes 3.5GB of RAM when idle, so you need really 8GB RAM in computer, if you take 4GB RAM laptop, Windows OS always has to keep swapping data between RAM and Storage to make space for your application running in RAM, so you will see slow performance when multiple files, apps are opened5. Ryzen 3 processor, this processor is equivalent to I3 processor Intel, both of them are basic/starting model. Processor does superb job plus 8GB ram and SSD helps  make everything work fast.  As this is a budget laptop you really do not have any other options of higher processor, having said that this processor is decent and wont let you down.To ensure my kids keep the laptop in good condition, I also purchased silicone keyboard cover, screen guard and laptop skin.\\n\\n\",\n",

Build quality is not good.2. Camera is not good but ok for online classes.3. Sound quality is not good.4. No VGA slots for connecting secondary monitor but you can connect using HDMI but HDMI cables are bit costly.5. No C-Type slot which is very useful now a days if you want to connect to Docking Station, etc.\\n\\n',\n",
              " \"\\n\\n  When the screen is black, you can see white fades at the edge of the screen (today I saw some more reviews with users having similar issue). I thought maybe it's a one off issue and asked for a replacement. However, after receiving the new product, the screen has some other issue. When the screen is white, you can see a shade of green at one end and a shade of red at the other end of the screen. Going to ask for another replacement. Let's see what happens.I think apart from the screen other components are okay but it's terrible to have paid 34k and get a defective screen on a brand new laptop.\\n\\n\",\n",

This one is 8 gb ram and 256 ssd and it takes around 10 seconds to switch on sometimes makes me doubt if I did switch it off or just was in sleep mode. So the laptop is fast enough.Camera is wide and captures a lot of area breath wise and good quality.Speakers are good compared to the earlier laptop I had.Also wifi supports 5 Ghz which is great so utilises my dual band router well.I guess the speed will diminish once I load more unwanted softwares but I guess this is good enough for my basic needs like Kid’s online class and other home needs.Special thanks to Dell support who on call helped me with office activation and other queries like media creation and laptop updates.
