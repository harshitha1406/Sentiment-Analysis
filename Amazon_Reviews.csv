  I am writing this review after using the laptop for one month.1) The MS office 2019 is original , just activate when you recieve it by login into your microsoft account. If you don't have a microsoft account create it.2) The laptop boots in just 3 to 4 second. It is very fast on SSD.3) The shutdown also takes just 3 second, thus you save your valuable time.4) The processing is also very reasonable and good at this price.5) It work for about 7 hour in one charge.6) Autocad 2017 is working fine on it.7) Overall the performance of the laptop is very good.One can buy it without any doubts.

  Worst service from Amazon and the seller. After buying this laptop I found that it's not suitable for running Android studio and I wanted to return it to get a higher configuration laptop but to my surprise I can't return it, the very next day.

  Purchased this laptop on 29th October 2019.Writing a review after almost 1 year of usage. To start with this laptop is very quick to start when powered on, hardly takes 5 seconds to start up.Great for those with basic requirements like daily surfing, Watching movies, MS office, Excel, Powerpoint and basic editing tasks. Due to SSD it works like charm.Pros- SSD makes it pretty fast with 5-7 seconds boot and start time. (I checked higher end models in shops but could not find one that starts as quickly this)- Light weight, this is pretty light and easy to carry, my earlier samsung laptop used to weigh almost 2 kgs and this slim trim piece comes as a delight to me in terms of weight.- Great battery life, haven't found any problems with battery life till now. It works 6-8 hours on a single charge easily. For me it is on almost for the entire day and it still works great.- Great volume, I am yet to see a laptop with so crystal clear sound. Most laptops have very low volume.- Got windows 10 and MS office students version license with it which is great add-on at this price point. (many higher priced laptops also don't provide this).Cons- Well almost none for me considering my requirements but you can find difficulties with viewing angles and screen resolution while watching movies, but I have no complains for it at this price point.ConclusionA great value for money laptop at this price point, After one year I can say that I am pretty happy with the purchase.

  Cant believe it's a HP Laptop. I don't think people should consider buying Laptop from Amazon.Amazon team don't take any accountability post the Product is sold. They sell through Partners and possibly fake products. The HP laptop INR >25K didnot last even for 3 months.Few pointers,- The Laptop didnot have a Serial Number (there is NO sticker label pasted on the body of the Laptop).- Thereafter I called up Amazon and raised this issue ... at first they did not acknowledge the problem. Finally, they accepted. However, NO resolution was provided.- Performance of the Laptop - the less you talk about it , the better it's. Its pathetically slow and HDD has already crashed. In terms of Config, it's 4GB/1TB HDD however the performance is worse than my 4 early old Laptop.It was a terrible experience for me. People should reconsider before buying from Amazon.

  If you are looking for a laptop for work from home or office use you should go for it without a second thought. Because of its great battery backup and speed due to SSD. Also it's lightweight and good looking too.But if you are looking for a laptop which should be both good for Work and Gaming you should consider buying another one, because of its low processor and graphics card. It's not good for gaming. You will get good average gaming laptops with more specifications under 40 - 50K if you are lucky.

Multitasking - 7 ( considering the price bracket it comes in it is justifiable.9. Heating issue - not faced till now but without fan it would be difficult to control the temperature.10. Value for money - 9Overall considering the price  of rs15000 and for my case it was rs 7200 (exchanged 10 yr old i3 processor laptop) this laptop does the light job like surfing net and making some ppts and watching video as the laptop has great screen - full hd with anti glare display is something that is unavailable in this price bracket before.Who should consider this laptop ?Anyone who has very light usage microsoft word, office , excel or those who wants a laptop for entertainment purpose, or for online classes, online test series, for attending meetings etcAnyone who wants to run any moderate to heavy apps should stay away from buying it.

  Recieved today.1. First impression is good.Does the job for the Price. Don't expect much from this by spending 13.5 k money.Expecting gaming and editing etc. from this low priced entry level machine is a foolish thing. Expect, upto what u spent on the product.(only disappointing factor who actually disappointed by their purchase)2. MS office is trail version only lasts for one week after setting it up.3. But, I don't know the reliability of this machine.4.I think it can be used for adequate period of time, if we handle it smoothly and carefully.5. Best under budget laptop with good built quality, sound and display6. A good replacement for tablet. Used for online classes for kids and documentation works and entertainment purposes....

You can't expect a scooter to carry the loads of a Truck. Same goes here. This laptop is made for basic tasks and it does flawlessly. Hence it is a perfect budget choice for students, online classes, office works etc.If you are in Gaming & video editing work..then please don't buy this laptop. This laptop is not made for such tasks.Thanks.

  So, I ordered this after reading the reviews of my predecessors. I can say I was not at all disappointed. I got this machine today and I am writing the review from this. Well, as I started to setup this up, I realized that it was too slow. I gave it the benefit of doubt and shut it down for later use. when I setup it up, the battery was around 70%. At the end of the setup it as 60. Fine, I give it an hour and resume exploring it. I set the mode to battery saver and cleansed all the unnecessary apps, and downloaded chrome and acrobat. I want to use this laptop for light browsing, creating word documents, reading pdfs and watching movies in spare time. Thus far, it has now disappointed. The display is amazing  and one can feel the SSD in action- crisp and sharp. I have used macbook air and this doesnt disappoint. Also, the design is very catchy, inspired from Macbook and Yoga 360. The price was also decent. Well, I started a 60% battery, remember- it is 34 now. The battery sis the only concern I see. but otherwise this is awesome. Zyada ungli mat karo- chup chap laptop kholo, normal use karo rakhdo. Zyada kalakari karne ki avashyakta nahi hai. If you expect that you can hack Iran's nuclear plant with this , then All the Best. Do not use it for heavy coding and games. Also the frame is decent ,not aluminum but plastic but I find it sturdy and ultra light. I will update this as I move with this machine.

Expect, upto what u spent on the product.(only disappointing factor who actually disappointed by their purchase)2. MS office is trail version only lasts for one week after setting it up.3. But, I don't know the reliability of this machine.4.I think it can be used for adequate period of time, if we handle it smoothly and carefully.5.

  So, I ordered this after reading the reviews of my predecessors. I can say I was not at all disappointed. I got this machine today and I am writing the review from this. Well, as I started to setup this up, I realized that it was too slow. I gave it the benefit of doubt and shut it down for later use. when I setup it up, the battery was around 70%. At the end of the setup it as 60. Fine, I give it an hour and resume exploring it. I set the mode to battery saver and cleansed all the unnecessary apps, and downloaded chrome and acrobat. I want to use this laptop for light browsing, creating word documents, reading pdfs and watching movies in spare time. Thus far, it has now disappointed. The display is amazing  and one can feel the SSD in action- crisp and sharp. I have used macbook air and this doesnt disappoint. Also, the design is very catchy, inspired from Macbook and Yoga 360. The price was also decent. Well, I started a 60% battery, remember- it is 34 now. The battery sis the only concern I see. but otherwise this is awesome. Zyada ungli mat karo- chup chap laptop kholo, normal use karo rakhdo. Zyada kalakari karne ki avashyakta nahi hai. If you expect that you can hack Iran's nuclear plant with this , then All the Best. Do not use it for heavy coding and games. Also the frame is decent ,not aluminum but plastic but I find it sturdy and ultra light. I will update this as I move with this machine.

  Review after using for 4 days.Pro's -1) Performance - It can easily handle basic tasks such as browsing, MS office, watching movies & online class.2) Storge - Even though we juz get 128gb ssd storage(out of which 94gb is available to use), we can expand Storage using memory card slot. One thing i liked in this laptop is we can easily insert memory card without card reader juz like we do in mobile phone. I brought 128gb sd card & inserted in it. I am storing all my files in the sd card. Don't store any files in system storge (128gb ssd slot). It will slowdown the Performance of system.3) Display & Sound - Top class 👍4) 🔋- OkayishCons -1) Charger pin is very loose. I m worried about its durability2) Hinge - I am really worried about hinge. It's very loose. Hope it won't fall down. Avita should focus on this4) Keyboard & mouse pad are hard.3) Build quality - Actually i don't say this as con for the price i paid(13600rs). I am satisfied with plastic built quality for this price. We need to be careful & make sure that laptop won't fall down from height.Finally if you are looking for basic laptop for online classes, Watching movies, MS office, browsing & if you can handle laptop carefully. Then go for it.

  Game changer is 128GB SSD, boots windows in 15-20 seconds.Browsing websites, watching videos, working on online worksheets is faster.Even 10 different browsing windows works fine. More than that slows down the Laptop.Not much heating initially but after 2-3 hours of continuous usage bottom gets heated.Very thin and lightweight and medium sturdy, so not for heavy rough and tough usage.Keyboard is good. Touchpad position is awkward and size big, so people with bigger palms will accidently touch mouse touchpad when typing.Overall after a month of usage, found not much issues for general usage of browsing/meetings/videos watching. Not tried any games and any external apps as Windows is in S mode. But with browser all apps usable, like spreadsheet, document editing, youtube, etc.

   Recent review- (earlier review can be found after recent)Since past couple or weeks I had observed mouse touch-pad issue. The movement of mouse is not as expected, it’s slow. I made all possible changes in settings but no use.It’s a bugger when I use MSPaint tool. While working in mspaint the mouse pointer suddenly jumps anywhere on the screen.(Attached video)I had registered complaint to Avita customer care about this and they attended in 2 days and the technician replaced entire touch pad along with keyboard. But still the problem was not resolved.I have again registered the complaint and will see what they do about it.Will keep you updated.....——————————-Below was the review I posted in first 4 days-——————————-A suggestion to laptop buyers is that before purchasing it, know what your own requirement is.I purchased this laptop for my son’s school activities like Online classes, video conferencing etc.Basic activities like MS Teams, MS Office, Browsing etc. can be done without any problems.As it comes with Windows 10 in S Mode, you have an option to disable it but I preferred not to, because its Secured mode and it helps to keep laptop safe from any Malware and saving you additional Antivirus cost.This laptop gives me battery backup of AT LEAST 4hrs with uninterrupted online class.Standby time would be definitely beyond that.Build quality is good according to its price. It costed me around 17k. I searched Amazon, Flipkart for budget laptops and this was the only one that deemed fit in my requirements.SSD really makes difference than conventional HDD. Its super fast, loads windows in seconds(depending on config).All ports are working fine. Please Note- This laptop DOES NOT have a Lan Port as it supports Bluetooth and Wifi only. As most of us are working on Wifi only, Lan port should not be an issue.Overall- I am satisfied with the laptop. I may change my review after couple of month’s usage if I see any difference in performance.

  I was very apprehensive of buying this computer but I did not have the budget to go for i3 or i5 so I bought this. Oh man ! this is one heck of a laptop. You will be delighted to lay your hands on this laptop. The screen is top quality, similar in quality to that found on many top-end models.  It is not shiney but matte which you can use for long periods of time without problem. The keyboard is decent and comfortable. The touchpad may have been better, it does not have the finesse of higher end models. The body is made of plastic but looks stunningly good. Hope it does not start showing signs of wear for some time.  The size of the laptop is just perfect, light-weight and very comfortable to work on. Speakers are ok, acceptable at this price point, sound is loud enough. It has a front camera which is Ok in quality but it is placed in a very odd position (near the screen and keyboard joint) which makes it not suitable for most face to face chats.The speed of the laptop is very good. It boots in 10 s and shuts down in the same time. All applications such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Office run smoothly. It does not show any lag even when I open a lot of programs together. Battery life is decent, about 3-4 hours on a single charge.All ports are located on the back side, not on the sides as in other laptops but this is not much of inconvenience and I am hardly inconvenienced because of this.The nest this about this laptop is the top quality screen. The worst thing is the placement of camera and probably a little less than perfect track pad (but not too bad).

  Since I have ps4 console, I bought this laptop only for office work, browsing and watching online stream videos.. If u need for basic use, go for it. This is not a gaming laptop.. I had Asus laptop previously and it sucks in performance and cost around 25k however i bought this laptop as exchange for 9k and the speed is awesome. Battery backup comes around 3hrs 30min if we watch videos. Normal use comes around 5hrs. Its very slim one weighing around 1.3kg only. Easy to carry not like my old asus(heavy one) and my office dell laptop(weighing around 2kg) Overall a good budget laptop Worth 9k for basic level. I will again update you guys after three month use.

  Below are my verdicts compared to the price I bought it (₹17,150)# Well built, nice looking, slim and light weight# Windows 10 built in, though in S mode, but S mode can be disabled with latest Windows updates# Decent performance for few light weight multi tasking, such as web surfing, playing songs via media player, documents editing, connecting to remote desktops. Dont expect any gaming performance from this humble device.# Keypad is nice, no backlit though# 2 USB ports, 1 HDMI# Screen display is really nice, nice resolution# Battery back up is fine. Depending on usage. I am getting in between 5 hours to 7 hours for very light weight use with battery saving mode enabled.# Camera quality is not upto the mark, could have been better# Mouse trackpad is nice, wide, intuitive# 4 Gig RAM serves the purpose# 120 GB SSD delivers good performance# Bottleneck is created by 2 vCPU Intel Celeron processors. But overall manages to deliver basic performance, CPU clocks upto 2.5 GHz when demand is High. L1 and L2 cache are on lower side, no L3 cache.# Speaker is loud enough, lacks the fineness / Quality, but does the job, you can watch YouTube, Movies, listen to songs..Overall, a nice well built laptop at this price with decent performance for basic activities, don't load it up with too many apps running in parallel, it will serve you well.Also, wait for offer price. It is a value for money product when bought at price around 17K, Not at its normal price which 19K

Speakers are bit inferior, but still good for the value. The batter charge stands well and charging is fairly quick. This is the first day impression. Well and safely packed.

  Light weight, stylish laptop good for basic office or house use, my daughter is happy to do her online classes and basic of coding. But one major issue is even though on the selling page it's written windows 365. And the buyer will assume that it's already installed like any other laptop, but this doesn't come with windows. And then one has to pay additional 5k per year. In that case it's total price will come closer to other branded laptop. One more thing which put me down is about there call center. If you have any issues or enquiries try to call God to help because the chances of getting a reply from God is more likely than Avita call center.

  This is a perfect laptop for every day use. Light weight and performance adequate. Though with celeron processor it works really well. You can easily get out of S mode and do installation of your like. Prints very well and moreover it comes with 24 months on site warranty. It's a must buy for people with lower budget.Let's see how it evolves in coming months.

  I didn't checked before buying that it comes with window s mode, s mode is not allowing any other web browser to install. but there is option which showing purchase other browser.Laptop is very slow, wrost working experience. although i purchased it only for internet surfing but it is useless for me because its not allowing other web browser than microsoft edge.Also in it having window 10, three days i have used, window 10 is auto consuming my internet in internal updates, and 2 gb internet consumed in less than 10 minutes, what a rubbing product how i can use internet in this system.I try to uninstall window 10 and install 8.1 or lower version but it not allowing to install other windows version too.finally when i use microsoft edge browser with broadband so that i have unlimited internet, but when you open multi tab it always goes slow or hang or other pages stop working . what a rubbish product it is. my fault is i didn't used it within 7 days of purchase, i thought  it is looking good from body, it should be good, but believe me it is horrible, I wish to give it 0 star. now i want to return it to seller, i am not getting how to do.complete money waste!!!!

  I was sceptical about the celeron processor but was pleasantly surprised to see the clock speed it can maintain (around 2.6 GHz) without a fan!SSD makes the performance even better, arguably the best in the price segment.Added plus is windows 10 home bundled! Display brightness is average but quality is good and bezels are thin. Webcam position is awkward and makes you look like you're rolling your eyes as you look at the screen during a video call.Build quality is questionable, but there are bound to be tradeoffs.

  Bought the laptop this month.My review would be helpful for those who intend to improve the workability on the device.The laptop comes with 4GB RAM and 5400RPM HDD which is not great. The laptop is horribly slow... But with the 1x upgradeable slot (not an extra empty, but only slot), you can insert either an 8gb 2400mhz or 2666mhz ram. That helps the situation, but still not much.There is an empty M.2 NVME SATA slot. Insert an SSD and use Macrium to clone the current HDD to the SSD. Once done, enter the BIOS and change the boot order.Voila.. you now have a great laptop at hand. It starts to work smooth as butter.The laptop has inbuilt DTS sound software packed as an add-on within Realtek driver. But the output from the speaker is not upto the mark. Use the free version of FX sound to get around this problem as it amplifies the audio. Output on headphones is good.The camera is so-so, but you cannot do anything about it.In all, the laptop works good only if you upgrade the internals. Thats when you unleash it's potential.If you have no plans to tinker with the hardware of the laptop, I suggest you choose a different product.

  इसे खरीदकर मैं खुद को ठगा सा महसूस कर रहा हूँ। 27500 रुपये का पूरा नुकसान हुआ। कंपनी ने हमें बेवकूफ बनाया। अगर सच कहूं तो कोई मुफ्त में भी दे तो भी ये लैपटॉप लेने लायक नहीं है। बिल्कुल बेकार प्रोडक्ट, ऐसी कोई समस्या नहीं जो इस लैपटॉप में नहीं है, इसे खरीदने से बेहतर है कि उस पैसे को कहीं दान कर दिया जाय।

Meant only for document typing and browsing purpose, nothing much you can expect other watching movies.3. Its all Google and Google only.4. Beginners will find it a bit difficult to use this.

  Do not fall into the trap of buying this product, this is HP’s conspiracy to dump an inferior product in the name of a chromebook. Ideally windows laptop are supposed to be expensive because of the payout for the OS & hence Chromebooks are supposed to be cheaper. In spite of this arrangement this laptop feels cheaper than a 25k windows laptop with probably a bigger screen. My mistake of trusting a brand like HP blindfoldedly. Not to mention the pain of dealing with a defective product on top of it.

  Overall good product to buy at this price range. Very much happy and easy to carry. It is good those who looking for normal usage of browsing, YouTube videos, small games with battery 🔋 backup of more than 12 hours if it is charged full battery.Pros:1. Good design and light weight. Easy to carry.2. Booting Speed less than 5 seconds.3. YouTube ads are default blocked by chrome OS and more convenient to watch YouTube videos like Premium without any charges per month.4. Very Good Battery 🔋 backup more than 12 hours.5. Browsing and touch screen is nice.6. Fast charging support.7. Price is less 25k budget Chromebook Laptop.Cons:1. Finding difficulty to type and save word document (Ex.,) Resume typing, etc., able to do only using online Google Docs and finds difficulty in Text alignment and copy to local harddrive, but feels not much convenient like Windows OS.2. If I connect my Samsung Galaxy A70 with Type C port, files are showing very slow, and not able to copy to harddrive. Instead of copy via Type C cable, I have copied via ""InShare Android App -> Web Sharing when connected to same WiFi"".3. Bluetooth Connection is failed frequently when we disconnected, we may needs to Reboot Chromebook again for restore connection, feeling very bad for this issue. Since, I am always use Bluetooth Speaker 🔊 for audio / playback.4. Not all Android apps are supported like mobile phones.5. Only low memory games supported otherwise, you will endup with Screen hanged up while loading the game.

  Sleek and light. Works better than any other Windows laptop in this price segment since Chrome OS is very much optimised. Browsing, surfing and streaming are fun on the go. Definitely, this one is not an option for seekers of intense computing but would be best for your daily work such as attending meetings and online classes (got a great camera quality). It supports most of the Android apps making it easy to get through things. The Intel Celeron N4020 & 4 gigs of RAM does it all. As far as memory is concerned. 64 GBs of SSD space is provided as well as 100 GBs of cloud storage for all which I find a little less. However, it's expandable to 256 GBs through micro SD cards.Overall, it's a great deal!

  Purchased this nearly three months ago, as a replacement for another HP Chromebook (which had it's own set of issues, but that's a whole other story).For starters, the screen is terrible. Speakers are tinny, and on the quiet side, never mind the B & o branding.The track-pad on my unit has developed an issue where it gets stuck, when pressed.Would not recommend.

  Brilliant productMost of the configurations available in this price range (less than 40k) were either 4 GB RAM or 1 TB HDDMy base requirement was 8 GB RAM as Win 10 just doesn't work with 4 GB and going for aftermarket RAM on a new laptop did not make senseSecond requirement was SSD. I needed anything at or beyond 256 GBThird requirement was latest generation of processor, 10th Gen in this caseFourth requirement that kind of became mandatory after I was doing the diligence was MS Office preinstalled. Again, why go for aftermarket installation. Note: lot of people complain that this is only for 30 days. That's not the case. I activated just by signing in and updating Office.The only other competition to this is Lenovo in similar price bracket, but it has a poor camera. With all the online classes and office, you can't look like crap just because you have a camera dating back to 2000s. All else are either expensive, do not have SSD, do not have 8 GB RAM or MS Office.The screen could have been better, but I have a 29 inch LG screen so no complaints.I missed checking if the swivel opens 180 degrees and this laptop doesn't open 180 degrees, so if you do use dual monitor then you have to place  adjacent to additional monitorVery satisfied till now.

  I've been using it for 3-4 days now. Experience wise it's great.

  It's the worst product ever. First time when I ordered this, it stopped working after two days. Software crashed. (EROOR CODE 3FO)When amazon replaced this order, nothing worked in replace order. I couldn't access camera or internet. I mean it was horrible. One after I unboxed ans it was useless.Reading the other reviews, I see a trend in these laptop. They all are cranking a little while after use. Heavy software problem. HP should pull this profile r out of market and replace it with better models.I was lucky that I found the fault after two days ( in replacement, one hour). You might not be so lucky. What if these laptops stop working after 7 days days replacement policy overdue.You are stuck with a dummy for a laptop and you are 36k. Please make q proper decision and buy a better laptop.

  Brilliant productMost of the configurations available in this price range (less than 40k) were either 4 GB RAM or 1 TB HDDMy base requirement was 8 GB RAM as Win 10 just doesn't work with 4 GB and going for aftermarket RAM on a new laptop did not make senseSecond requirement was SSD. I needed anything at or beyond 256 GBThird requirement was latest generation of processor, 10th Gen in this caseFourth requirement that kind of became mandatory after I was doing the diligence was MS Office preinstalled. Again, why go for aftermarket installation. Note: lot of people complain that this is only for 30 days. That's not the case. I activated just by signing in and updating Office.The only other competition to this is Lenovo in similar price bracket, but it has a poor camera. With all the online classes and office, you can't look like crap just because you have a camera dating back to 2000s. All else are either expensive, do not have SSD, do not have 8 GB RAM or MS Office.The screen could have been better, but I have a 29 inch LG screen so no complaints.I missed checking if the swivel opens 180 degrees and this laptop doesn't open 180 degrees, so if you do use dual monitor then you have to place  adjacent to additional monitorVery satisfied till now. Boot time with SSD is awesome, the system boots in under 10 seconds.Although it says 1.47 kg it feels a tad heavier.

  Super product by HP. Got this HP 14s cf3047tu at Rs 35990 on great indian sale. Awesome Performance! Writing this review after 1 week of usage... Here is the detailed review of the product..Battery backup is impressive. If you are not a heavy user it can last for a day. ( 9/10 )Performance wise it's a beast.. with 8GB of ram, i3 10th gen processor and SSD storage you will not face any problem related to speed and performance. Windows boots in just 6-7 seconds. The software or apps takes max of 3 seconds to load... I have not faced any lagging issue till now. ( just avoid high end softwares and games and your laptop will work like a charm ) (10/10 )Display is also good... I don't know why people are complaining about it. Also bezels are not too thick as in dell vostro and others. (8/10)Looks are also decent with patterned surface which feels amazing to fingers and also provides a good grip. (8/10)Sound is AWESOME! at 100% volume it feels like i am playing music over a Speaker... It is really loud. You'll have to keep volume at 40-50% for general use.You'll not get any other laptop with this sound quality at this price. Really! (10/10)Camera is Average or you can say good for video calling purposes... As you don't have to take selfies with it.So finally, This laptop is good in every feature. A power packed machine by HP. You will not get any other laptop with this type of performance, speed, sound and battery for this amazing price. Better than vivobook 14, vostro and ideapad series. Just Go For It!Overall rating 9/10.(you also get a lifetime version of MS Office 2019 home & student - powerpoint, word, excel & one note which comes preinstalled with it that is you just have to sign in with ms account in any of the application and you will unlock the office suit)Also a big thanks to Amazon. They delivered it within 2 days of ordering.- vivek 😊

  Purchased this as replacement for my aged HP ProBook 440G1. Replaced an i7 with this i3 option for these reasons: Latest technology -11 Gen, 2021 model, SSD, 8GB RAM. Did not want to spend a lot as I have a Surface Pro. Got 12k in exchange for the 440G1. So this fit all the bills. First impression of product is good. Plastic feel was the only putoff, but you can't expect a metallic body at this price. Laptop doesn't feel very sturdy for the plastic body. Booting / Shutdown is very fast because of SSD. 8GB RAM is min required for decent Windows 10 performance. Screen resolution is good. Very lightweight so you will not mind it carrying around. Easy to activate both windows and MS Office with instructions given on product page in Amazon. Overall, a decent product that won't dent a hole in your pocket. Would have given 4 star had the body been metallic and sturdier.

  Amazing speed, at first I had issues with start menu response but later fixed by update. Only laptop in the range with 8Gb ram. Keyboard is perfect as the button's stiffness  is well manged. Very light and almost negligible bezels. Only problem is the display which is HD and not FHD, although resolution  doesn't  make much difference but the inaccurate colour reproduntion and lack of Antiglare coting makes it an average display. Battery life is 6hrs + once full, charging is fine alomost 2 hrs. Overall I cant find a better laptop in this range.

  Before you go for this product, also keep in mind that how much money you spend on this laptop.After exchange, I got it at 32k.At this price, it's more than I expected.Intel i3 processor is enough for my needs. I even run VMs with 2 core. I don't want to launch 3-4 VMs so that's reasonable for me.SSD and 8GB is very quick and smooth operations.Genuine Windows and Office is a plus. One less thing to worry about.Last, Amazon is very good that it got delivered same day...

Only advantage of this laptop is thin and fast boot due to ssd.5. Least quality Graphics6. My final advice is... Go for different models.. This is built with least quality material. And motherboard  doesn't support even small applications... Dell inspiron models are seems best as I used it earlier.

  Its been a week , so far so good. Only disadvantages are the screen's viewing angle are terrible and back lit keyboard is a must for laptop which costs more than 35k.Apart from these issue it is one hell of a laptop in the price point and its super light and compact with a decent battery backup of 5hrs + for now although I guess it will fall to 3hrs in around 6 months time as per my experience with Hp( Finger Crossed ) .

  Review is for the 10th gen i3 - 2 core model laptopProsCompact  size / weight to carry around.Windows 10 Home for life time.Office 10 (I guess that is only Word, PowerPoint and Excel) but for single user .Has Ethernet LAN connectivity (newer models do not have this).8 GB RAM (contrary to the 4 GB mentioned on HP site for this model)  which will give good performance .256 GB SSD storage, improves speed and handles shocks.ConsA little reflective screen.No DVD drive.Both  the legacy USB Connectors as well as Power Supply  connector are on Right hand side while 1 USB .Type C USB connector is on left hand side.Wifi speeds are only upto 150 Mbps,  though YouTube streaming experience was good without any lag.

  In less than a month, the laptop failed while in operation. The SSD hdd is not accessible although the diagnostics indicate the disk is fine. From the reviews, it appears the laptop model has inherent problem & hence should be called back by hp and replaced with functional/tested models. Other features like light weight & thickness are overridden due to these failures leading to data loss.

  Bought this laptop during about 3 weeks ago during the Navratri sale offer. Delivery was quite prompt, got it properly packaged the very next day.Usage wise quite satisfied. Battery backup is also good.Regarding display, am satisfied for regular googling / reading, even watching a movie is decent. Screen was not very clear during a Zoom call.So overall am quite happy with this laptop for regular use.

  Look no further if your budget is 36K, close your eyes and buy it. 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and I3 10th Gen with MS OFFICE-License configuration you won't get it anywhere else. It boots in just 5 Sec with super fast performance. Initial Setup is very easy and you can do it yourself. Also if you follow Video uploaded by seller, registering MS OFFICE License is also easy. Display and Camera is ok (not best). Speakers are loud and clear. Overall a great buy.

  It's a pathetic product. Very bad build quality looks fragile. Never expected such kind of product from HP that is too through Amazon. The quality is highly detoriated and.when I am asking for the return through refund Amazon Customer Care people are giving absurd policy reference.

  Speed is fast. Very quick boot time.Build is average. But performance was very good after initial 3-4 days of usage.Need to have Microsoft account in order to activate the laptop first time. Also it's required to activate the MS office product which comes pre installed with laptop.If you have opted for old laptop in exchange then delivery might get delayed as in my case they could not arrange and it got delayed by 2 days.But overall experience with laptop is good. Battery back up satisfactory. At least for 4-5 hours. Camera quality is average. Sound is good. Since it's ssd, much faster than traditional hdd.

  I have been using this device for almost 3 months. For the price there aren't many laptops under 40K with offer 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, and Office as well. This laptop has some good compromises for the price. No backlight keyboard but a good, comfortable keyboard. No FHD display but a decent battery life. The SSD speeds are pretty fast as well. So a fast boot up. Speakers are also decent.Overall, I use it everyday for work and no problems till now.

  This is an amazing product for liye coders. Who are noob in coding they can try this lappy.SSD- because of ssd the timing of loading am operation and opening the os is little faster.RAM 8GB- 8 GB ram is enough for specific coders. It is good for multitasking. But don't try this if you are a heavy gamer or heavy coder.KEYBOARD- keyboard is greally good. Easy for typing but there is no numpad.TOUCHPAD- a fine and smooth touchpad with mat finish which is appreciatable.Screen- Full hd and 14 inch. You may find it a little small but still it is very much clear.OS - windows 10 is preloaded in SSD. Therefore the machine is faster than others.MS OFFICE- ms office is also preloaded. You need not to buy or download it.HARD DISK- 1 TB hard disk is there.LAN PORT- LAN port is given.USB PORT- only 2 USB port at your right side.SD CARD PORT- available at left side.CHARGING POINT- at your right side.HEADPHONE POINT- at your right side.CAMERA- camera is quiet okay for normal video calling.KEYLIGHT- Keyboard light is not available.Battery- you can use it up to 6 hrs.All over you can buy this if you are a lite coder. But not recommended to heavy gamer or coder.

  I m writing this review after using for about nearly two months . So i bought hp i3 8th gen 8g 256gb ssd model . Im a college student casual user only for powerpoint and browsing only i decided to go for it .Basically i was using old model of hp laptop only with amd old processor which gave lot of problems i cannot able to use that for simple one. I searched compared with other laptop also .when i bought i purchased for 36k i dont know why price been increased while that time some of the model like asus laptop avita were good also they were not some thing to look like asus had 4gb ram and typically having hesitant to with amd ryzen processor.This laptop till now basically fine it will feel compact also microsoft office free version preinstalled that also major advantage there are some things to be look after like:- Only one time i faced lag or hang i dont know  why i had put my pen drive so due to that may be i faced other than that i didnt hang problem.-While update notification the laptop like flickering the screen blackish that i also faced twice after updating it will not come.-Also keyboard also it  good feel will not comfortable to type it will feel cheap feel quality but mousepad feels fine. it necessary to wireless keyboard .-while turning pressing power button for turning on the laptop i feel that i have to press 2 times for that i dont know why but boot time is like 3 seconds .These are all things that need to be considered although it is not a major con somehow have to check with that.Performance is decent normal use whilw i played wcc2 game that feels like hiccups happened anyhow it is a decent processor no heating problem or fan noise i didnt heard of till now.Another thing that everyone should after is that battery backup the battery capacity mentioned like 41 or 42whr so claiming less than 7hr majorily i also one of the reason i bought but decent battery backup only charging also take less than 2hrs last 5 percent takes time little battery backup at a stretch use u will less than 4 hrs only.Screen quality is hd only it is decent enough.FINAL VERDICT: Overall i suggest for buying this laptop mainly should be based on price only for 42k we can get better laptop also ig u get a price of 35 to 38k it will make much sense and value for money.Also mi laptop learing edition will be there still it is not that available there are not that much review i didnt go for it . other than it is only available above 40k better buy mi laptop with i5 gen or asus laptop mainly there will be i3 only it will be available Regard with amd processor in amd ryznen 3 or 5 are available in avita brand or some other company also but still not suggest only in case of heating or battery draining issue this with old experience of processor also review of other laptop only im saying.U can buy hp mi acer and asus with ssd option better value .Also thing this laptop im not sure about we cant add ram or expandable that thing need to check after in cas of mi laptop im sure that is not upragable.

  This laptop is excellent for budget programmers! I could easily run Pycharm, VS Code and close to 8 tabs of Chrome simultaneously without any lags. Boot time is excellent owing to 256GB SSD. Glare does exist but, well you are getting this at about 35k, so some faults do exist. Also camera quality is poor, but again I actually never felt the need to use it frequently.Also if you ask about gaming, then I just had tested Prototype 2, and it did work fine enough even at high settings.The fact that you get lifetime access of Microsoft Office and Student 19, is a huge plus point.

  So I've used it for 2 days . According to me it's a good choice in this price , well i bought it from this seller itself at 26990 , now the price is shown 31000 .still it's great choice because in the Shop's in my town it's priced 35000 .so now performance , it does what it says , lag free smooth operation i tried 4k video which were stuttering in the i3 desktop in my friends house , it worked in the lap like we used to play 720p in my friends i3 desktop , i skipped many times quickly but never shown a bit of lag etc.. it was smooth and responsive . The build quality was also nice and lightweight . The dolby audio was clear as said . The camera was 0.3mp only . Well can do video call but not a clear hd video call. Screen was also very good after the updating of the graphics software (from windows update) . because when we get the settings are tuned in for power , it Last for around 6 hours with movies , software etc.. effortlessly . But i updated the graphics software and tuned to for maximum visual appearance , still it Lasted 4 hours with all sorts of usage including video editing apps , 4k video playback etc... The screen is mat Which is very nice , but in outdoors at noon etc the brightness may feel a bit not enough , but in indoors etc it's clear . It comes preloaded with windows 10 home latest version so windows update won't use much data , it's activated lifetime . It also has office 360 trial ! . and McAfee antivirus trial ! .i already had a key of office 2016 so i installed it amd activated it works smooth . also i had subscription of Kaspersky so switched to it . It has 1tb hdd ,two 3.2 usb port and one 2.0 usb port .one slot for sdcard , slot to add a ssd and a extra ram ,a HDMI port . The package contained laptop ,and charger ,and guarantee slip .the user manual must be downloaded from internet a qr code is provided to download it .i bought the ryzen 3 version . so that's my review in quick glance.i'll update as i remember. If i missed anything .

   This laptop sucks even for basic use like video watching and ms office (it doesn't come with ms office you have to buy it or download pirated version). If you are on a tight budget, you can buy this and then install a ssd and aditional 4 gb ram stick to make it usable. Heats quite a bit after 30 mins of continuous usage. Integrated graphics reserve around 800 MB of ram due to which only 3.4 GB of ram is usable. So an additional ram stick is must. Dual core processor is on the weaker side, fans get ramped up quite a bit which is annoying.The only pro i can think of is the screen quality which is decent according to the price(note that brand has cut corners to give full hd panel at this price). If you are a programmer stay away from this machine and build a PC(you can build a great PC at 25k).

  I was expecting some basic experience but it struggles a lot. My HP pavilion with 2.2GHZ works better than this. I was like oh god what I have did, because I have exchanged my pavilion to get this.but now, 3rd power on after driver updates, BIOS update, now 2004 version is downloading, it's better ( only a nominal paise better)but I need to keep considering the price and it has camera and Mic which my pavilion does not have.To get this far, I need to apply Windows improve performance support link on new laptop with AMD ( I do not know what happened to AMD ( might be they are concentrating on other things where Intel dominates).I truly disappointed with this performance. Every time I click I click I click, I need to wait. In edge browser typing like stuttering.Think Edge is like that ( which is lightest) than any browser for Windows.The display is glare glare glare if you do not have proper lighting.I use on natural light, even with 20 watt LED room light, it glares.so far, as it was mentioned in the product pictures, the AMD Athlon version is tablet replacement and it is complete 15.6 inch ( need to check diagonal).I saw one review with horizontal measurement so clarifying others who check reviews before buying it.It has integrated RAM 4GB, usable 3.38GB and 1 TB Seagate usable 930GB.Over all, I'm keeping as it serves my purpose and basic working laptop with Windows home OS and Office 2019 ) the software's itself comes close to the laptop price if it bought separately.The funny part, I have HP omen Rs.1Lakh and above, this laptop I bought for R.22,000, my family likes this one than Omen since it has brushed aluminum like feel platinum grey compared to Omen matte black.Update 24/10/2020.Now, the laptop seems to be better.After 2004 update installed, I have 1.4GB RAM left for other applications.Total 4GB RAM > user available 3.38 GB ( pathetic) I don't know the user available is so low due to RAM is directly soldered to the Mother board. Windows only uses 1.9 to 2GB.but anyhow, I need to upgrade RAM or user experience might not be best.Update 07/11/2020.I need to upgrade the RAM if not, the user experience would be like order coffee and get it by tomorrow but you need it today.The display is like kind of white (eee) not balanced sharpness/contrast and brightness. I use it for my work and rest is Netflix, Amazon prime and movies collection I have.The exceptional part of this laptop is sound. Yes, the sound. The sound is best, way better than any computer ( I should say) or is it because of Dolby atmos.Yes, I'm typing it in the middle of the movie to praise the sound quality.and yes, I could conclude to myself Dolby atmos is better than DTS X with Bang & Olufsen . Yes, it is. Hail to Dolby.Update 15/11/2020,Installed 4GB 2400MHZ RAM, even though this model compatible up to 12GB RAM since it has 4GB onboard RAM (soldered directly to the motherboard) I'm forced to use 4GB RAM.If I use 8GB RAM + 4GB onboard RAM, I get the average of these 2, which could 12/2=6GB RAM which is now my usable RAM 4GB RAM added + 4GB ono board RAM.Yes, the performance is increased. Additionally I set Windows search indexing to manual so yes the performance is far better improved. Tested multiple application simultaneously.Windows explorer + Edge ( 2 tabs)+ Chrome (2 tabs) + Task manager + Excelall the applications worked better than earlier ( pl.refer my earlier review in the above messages).Note: Total 8GB installed RAM, 2GB allocated to integrated GPU as a dedicated RAM which is the beauty and welcome thing I like. Since the laptop has integrated GPU comes with 512MB dedicated RAM ( occupies the RAM installed or shares the 4GB RAM installed)Now, the integrated RAM increased to 2GB which would help me in running GTA V at low settings easily.and 8GB+ 4GB =12/2 usable RAM would be around 10 or 11GB but the performance would be equal to 6GB.When we are using dual channel memory, we need to always equip same amount of RAM to get same amount of performance.Suggestion to Lenovo: Please provide at least onboard 6GB or 4GB fully usable RAM.To buyers, buy RAM along with the laptop. Seriously it meets the requirements and need.All these reviewing are done with power adapter connected and Extreme performance mode.The thing I feel could be provided better is the display.The thing I feel wow about this product is the sound.

  At such price the laptop is good for basic office work and some online browsing work. Also good for students for online learning, teaching.Please verify first while purchasing the device for compatibility of software you are going to use.Also the warranty mentioned is from 28th September 2020 to 27th September 2021.

  The product description clearly mentions that MS Office Student Home 2019 is Pre-installed. This was one of the reasons for selecting this laptop. However, on activation it shows that MS Office is available for only upto 20 September 2020. This is unfair selling practice.

  I was expecting some basic experience but it struggles a lot. My HP pavilion with 2.2GHZ works better than this. I was like oh god what I have did, because I have exchanged my pavilion to get this.but now, 3rd power on after driver updates, BIOS update, now 2004 version is downloading, it's better ( only a nominal paise better)but I need to keep considering the price and it has camera and Mic which my pavilion does not have.To get this far, I need to apply Windows improve performance support link on new laptop with AMD ( I do not know what happened to AMD ( might be they are concentrating on other things where Intel dominates).I truly disappointed with this performance. Every time I click I click I click, I need to wait. In edge browser typing like stuttering.Think Edge is like that ( which is lightest) than any browser for Windows.The display is glare glare glare if you do not have proper lighting.I use on natural light, even with 20 watt LED room light, it glares.so far, as it was mentioned in the product pictures, the AMD Athlon version is tablet replacement and it is complete 15.6 inch ( need to check diagonal).I saw one review with horizontal measurement so clarifying others who check reviews before buying it.It has integrated RAM 4GB, usable 3.38GB and 1 TB Seagate usable 930GB.Over all, I'm keeping as it serves my purpose and basic working laptop with Windows home OS and Office 2019 ) the software's itself comes close to the laptop price if it bought separately.The funny part, I have HP omen Rs.1Lakh and above, this laptop I bought for R.22,000, my family likes this one than Omen since it has brushed aluminum like feel platinum grey compared to Omen matte black.Update 24/10/2020.Now, the laptop seems to be better.After 2004 update installed, I have 1.4GB RAM left for other applications.Total 4GB RAM > user available 3.38 GB ( pathetic) I don't know the user available is so low due to RAM is directly soldered to the Mother board. Windows only uses 1.9 to 2GB.but anyhow, I need to upgrade RAM or user experience might not be best.Update 07/11/2020.I need to upgrade the RAM if not, the user experience would be like order coffee and get it by tomorrow but you need it today.The display is like kind of white (eee) not balanced sharpness/contrast and brightness. I use it for my work and rest is Netflix, Amazon prime and movies collection I have.The exceptional part of this laptop is sound. Yes, the sound. The sound is best, way better than any computer ( I should say) or is it because of Dolby atmos.Yes, I'm typing it in the middle of the movie to praise the sound quality.and yes, I could conclude to myself Dolby atmos is better than DTS X with Bang & Olufsen . Yes, it is. Hail to Dolby.Update 15/11/2020,Installed 4GB 2400MHZ RAM, even though this model compatible up to 12GB RAM since it has 4GB onboard RAM (soldered directly to the motherboard) I'm forced to use 4GB RAM.If I use 8GB RAM + 4GB onboard RAM, I get the average of these 2, which could 12/2=6GB RAM which is now my usable RAM 4GB RAM added + 4GB ono board RAM.Yes, the performance is increased. Additionally I set Windows search indexing to manual so yes the performance is far better improved. Tested multiple application simultaneously.Windows explorer + Edge ( 2 tabs)+ Chrome (2 tabs) + Task manager + Excelall the applications worked better than earlier ( pl.refer my earlier review in the above messages).Note: Total 8GB installed RAM, 2GB allocated to integrated GPU as a dedicated RAM which is the beauty and welcome thing I like. Since the laptop has integrated GPU comes with 512MB dedicated RAM ( occupies the RAM installed or shares the 4GB RAM installed)Now, the integrated RAM increased to 2GB which would help me in running GTA V at low settings easily.and 8GB+ 4GB =12/2 usable RAM would be around 10 or 11GB but the performance would be equal to 6GB.When we are using dual channel memory, we need to always equip same amount of RAM to get same amount of performance.Suggestion to Lenovo: Please provide at least onboard 6GB or 4GB fully usable RAM.To buyers, buy RAM along with the laptop. Seriously it meets the requirements and need.All these reviewing are done with power adapter connected and Extreme performance mode.The thing I feel could be provided better is the display.The thing I feel wow about this product is the sound.

It takes 20 minutes to just start and then you can start working.Its worst than our desktop of year 1999-2000 eraWhen I tried checking the issue it’s showing disk utilisation 100% while I am having less than 100gb data in 1 TB CAPACITY hdd.I have Mcafee Total protection license to protect this device which is recommended by Lenovo themselves.I will never ever recommend such a useless product to even my enemy.I have all laptops till date I brought from Lenovo but after this experience I must say I feel like getting cheated by LENOVO and dealer.Its better not to sale such products which are not worth using a day.DO NOT BUY EVEN YOU DONT CARE ABOUT MONEY, it’s as good as you are buying garbage for 22K.

  It was said it has ms office home and Student 2019 but it was not there in the laptop only the trial version given then I had to contact lenovo and microsoft for this, microsoft said that they need ms office home & student 2019 mentioned on the invoice also as on the invoice amazon has mentioned only ms office 2019. I faced lot of problems because of this u had to continuously call amazon, lenovo, microsoft on this issue. amazon was not ready to provide any confirmation at first whether it had ms office 2019 the finally after calling for two days I found one customer care executive in leadership team who helped me by sending me a mail which included all the details of the laptop plus she mentioned it has ms office home and Student 2019 then the prob got solved by the microsoft had to even fight with Microsoft too on this issue as it's not the customer's mistake that they trusted amazon. I'm buying it from Amazon not from a lenovo outlet. This caused me lot of problems and tension as they give only 7 days time for return/replacement also. Very bad service by Amazon but that Amazon's leadership executive's service was amazing I gave her five stars. And the laptop is very very slow it hangs also be careful before buying it.

  Hi, used the product for 20 days by now.1. good display FHD.2. Ryzen 3 is best compared with i3.3. Windows 104. Smooth working for 4 gb ram but you have to increase it upto 12gb I guess.5. Nice texture6. Very good ventilation when compared with other laptop like hp.7. Thin8. Battery comes close to 4 hr when used for browsing or for videos I suggest use it in battery saver mode.9. Call (mail) customer service and update warranty for up to 1 year.10. Speakers are above average.11. Keys are very nice to work.12. Hinges are far better now, as it is a long one.13. I suggest to uninstall antivirus (Windows firewall is sufficient) and install chrome for smooth usage(stop that explorer).14. Night vision is good.I brought it for 22k !!! U may get surprised.So,.  5 🌟 rating.My opinion:- go for it, it doesn't disappoint you. I think this combination is good . so, it will definitely hit high from now in the market and I will update after some usage.Edit 1:- after 2 months1. I feel display is not great. As it is not IPS2. BATTERY should have been still better than this.3. Main point is it takes time, initially though , for Right click to work.4. AMD gives updates.Edit 2:- After using it for 8 months now.1.) Just increase RAM for better performance2.) Really better than all Intel i3 processor.3.) Don't use it for advanced gaming.JUST HIT LIKE buttonEdit 3:- After using it exactly 1.5 years.It updates regularly, but it irritates as it takes to update for hours, initially when I start it shows lenovo logo and then going screen completely blank.  It happened to me 2 times for hours. LENOVO PLEASE FIX IT.

  I purchased the Ryzen 3 edition of this laptop.CPU performance wise it is very good for lightweight day to day work such as browsing, watching movies, some Excel and PowerPoint work etcI am using it Transcend 110S NVMe SSD and 8 GB Crucial DDR4 2400 RAM CT8G4SFS824A and performance is much better now.This laptop cannot use M.2 SATA SSD such as Western Digital Green or Blue M.2 SATA SSD. Only NVMe SSDs are compatible. You can install a NVMe SSD as an OS drive while still using the internal 1 TB HDD for storing files.The screen has moderate viewing angles but you can live with that.

  I purchased the Ryzen 3 edition of this laptop.CPU performance wise it is very good for lightweight day to day work such as browsing, watching movies, some Excel and PowerPoint work etcI am using it Transcend 110S NVMe SSD and 8 GB Crucial DDR4 2400 RAM CT8G4SFS824A and performance is much better now.This laptop cannot use M.2 SATA SSD such as Western Digital Green or Blue M.2 SATA SSD. Only NVMe SSDs are compatible. You can install a NVMe SSD as an OS drive while still using the internal 1 TB HDD for storing files.The screen has moderate viewing angles but you can live with that.

  Bought this laptop with high hopes but found out its too slow and piece of junk. Feels like I am using laptop which is 5 years old. Touchpad is worst and extremely worst in responding. Processor and GPU struggle to keep the speed up of the laptop. I have not used any heavy softwares or games untill now. My review is based upon the normal web browsing and watching netflix. Even with this kind of light load, this laptop performs worst and hangs continuously. Run away from this laptop and avoid wasting your money

  It's unfortunate I had to return this laptop cos it was slow and had been slightly damaged when shipping otherwise all the other features were good. I'm not too sure whether i3 7th gen would have made a difference or not but I think 8GB RAM was definitely needed for this to run smoothly. Best budget piece at 27500. If more RAM were given and priced at 30k, I'd have still bought it, cos it had a 15.6"" FHD Screen, 1TB HDD, MS Office 2019 & even remained cool. No overheating. The battery lasted for 5 Hours at least. If it comes back in stock, I'll buy it again!

  I bought this for my 10 years old. For a starter who plans to use a laptop for browsing, attending online classes, playing not-so-heavy online games, basic documentation works (word, powerpoint, excel) - this is a good enough one.Pros: - Value for money laptop. - Comes with inbuilt Windows 10 and pre-installed MS Office packages. - Relatively thin and light weight. - Good key pad arrangement - Touch pad with in-built click buttons - Ryzen-3 processor, takes a minute or two for booting but this is expected as this does not come with SSD. - Haven't observed any heating issues so far even after a continuous use of 4-5 hours or gaming or video. - Came with 1 year warranty. There was a student offer - 3 years extended warranty + On-site service + Sony headphone with mic for Rs.1799. It's a very good deal. - Decent battery life of 3-4 hours of continuous use.Cons: - Screen resolution is not so great - Webcam quality is poor - In-built speaker quality is decent not loud enough. We are using it with a headphone. - Charger has a peculiar shape and design. - There a warranty date mismatch which was sorted out after talking to the customer care.Go for it, if you plan to buy this for kids or basic daily use.

  Edit:The difference in performance after adding and booting from SSD drive is phenomenal! It feels like a completely new (much slicker) laptop now!Although, I realised all too late that the SSD slot on the laptop supports NVME type SSD (and not SATA). Choose what you buy carefully.Original Review:I've had this laptop for 9 months now and can confidently say it's woefully underpowered. I knew even at the time of buying that 4GB ram might be too less and that was apparent on the day I powered the laptop on. Booting took ages and everything worked at grandma speed.I upgraded the ram to 12GB the first week of operation itself which helped quite a bit. However, I've struggled to get anything important done on this laptop in the last 9 months of owning it. I mostly use it to watch Netflix or maybe light surfing on chrome.Recently figured that the HDD itself is also a bottleneck, and have now had to order a additional SSD to run the OS in. Hopefully that will solve it for me.Verdict : buy only if you're comfortable upgrading the laptop on your own or have access to a cheap repair shop. Total cost for me - 25K (laptop) + 2.5K (8GB RAM) + 3.5K (250GB M2 SSD) which I think is still much cheaper than buying an equivalent laptop directly.

  I purchased this laptop for 24500 which is a total steal for this laptop. Ryzen 3 works fine, don't expect to run heavy applications or games on it. 4gig of Ram and 1Tb HDD is also great for the price. The screen is a total plus point, its an FHD screen, it's a VA panel I guess but for anyone, it's much much better than those 768p HD displays. It is sharp and great to look at. Not good with the viewing angles (obviously a VA panel), but it is good enough. The speaker is fine and the keyboard is also fine for me. The battery life also seems to be okay with about 3-4 hours of backup. Only get this laptop if you are a normal user that does browsing, watching movies and typing or for basic office use, do not expect more than that.What I would suggest is to increase the ram to 8 gigs and if you can, please replace the HDD with a 2.5 inch SSD. Just by doing these 2 things, it will run much more smoothly than you can even imagine.

  Overall an 'OKAY' laptop. Amazing looking laptop (doesn't mean it's an amazing laptop though). If you're getting it for 25k and below that, it's the best laptop one can own at that price range. For I had to pay a bit more(28k) as GST had increased at the time (19 June 2020). I bought this for college assignments (on social sciences). It was urgent for me to buy and the screen impressed me when I saw this laptop on videos. I had a lot of expection with the screen when it arrived but the Full HD, anti-glare technology screen is misleading; ""anti glare"" is just for the name's sake, yes it doesn't reflect so much of  light but it's definitely is not 'anti glare', it should have been named ""less glare"". Moreover, it's side angle view is quite annoying at times, esp. if there are many people in a room watching movie in it. However it's 15.6 inch display almost feels like a  standard desktop's screen and has a resolution better than that of hp and acer laptops of this price range. So if you are a student looking a laptop for basic college works at low buget then this is the one for you but only if you are not angry with China because yes it's made there. Haha. Happy shopping.

  Received the product on time, within  3 days. The laptop looks premium. Even though it is plastic body, it looks like aluminum. The thin bezel screen gives a stylish and latest look for the laptop. The specs are good. As youtube reviews states, the RAM and hard disk can be upgraded, which is a great thing. Since the hard disk is empty and there aren't much programs, the laptop is fast as of now. MS office is provided. The sound on this laptop is good. Everything works fine. Happy with the product.

  I m so disappointed that I just requested for return. I already have a Lenovo laptop and this made me confident to go with this brand. About the product, installation instructions are smooth. Issue starts afterwards. First heartbreak you will find the performance. When you try to open web browser like app, it will open with so delay that you once think of, have I clicked the app or not. Even my daughter who has used mobiles and laptop wondered, such delay actually happens in now world. Coming to sound, it's average.Second most disappointment is with camera. Due to Covid19, she is having virtual class and when she attended first session from this laptop, it was quite dark. She switched to my laptop again, to resume her class. With such configurations, I was really expecting that it will stand good for my kids requirement. Either I mistakenly got bad laptop or my choice is not good. Let's see, when this laptop gets replaced, it will change for better or not... Not expected for Lenovo...  :(

However, since day one i.e. June 09, 2020 the said product did not perform as required and we faced speed issue on number of occasions. It takes ample of time for any application to open. Due to these issues, my daughter was unable to concentrate in her studies and her performance was badly affected. She is mentally disturbed because of very slow performance of the said product.In the month of December 2020, I had called the customer care and I was informed to set-up the Lenovo diagnostic tool and scan the laptop on regular basis. I followed the instructions provided to me, however, the problem could not be fixed and my daughter continued to suffer hardships and mental harassment.Recently, I once again called the customer care and was forced to lodge a complaint on March 04, 2021. On a lot of back and forth with the customer care, I was informed that the said product will perform slow on Windows 10 and that I should use Windows 08 for the said product to perform properly.

  After a 6 month use,  we just can't find any problems. Well this proves to be the best choice at this range in spite of not having a fingerprint sensor and USB type C port. Below are the reasons :1. Comes With MS OfficeYou might see reviews starting they didn't receive the office package. That isn't true. Sometimes they wouldn't have found where it is.2. Super upgradable(if wanted for heavy tasks)You can expand its RAM up to a massive 20 GB and it has an additional M.2 NvMe SSD port. That's a boon.3. Immersive audio experienceDolby does makes the audio much better.4. Lenovo online SupportWell driver downloading isn't a problem now. The website detects your system and does it automatically (drivers excluded in Windows updates)5. Light GamingNot much I can ensure but you can play games like ones of Assassins creed family,most racing games and other stuffs in medium graphics.Rest you can find in the other reviews as well.

  It's been a month since purchase I want to share my personal reviewThis laptop is definitely a good choice only if you are here for study purpose and light game like gta SA ,vice city etc but when it comes to heavy gaming like valorant,gta V and similar this laptop isn't a good choice.This laptop have 512 MB of vram so you guys already know what you can do in this.Battery backupBattery backup for this laptop is lowest it shows it will work for 3 hrs but even if I leave it at standby without any process it hardly last for 1.5-2 hrs so poor battery backup.Ram4gb ram isn't enough for your processes even many a times my Microsoft office hangs so make sure you attach a good ram after purchase preferably a 8gb.Touchpad and KeyboardTouchpad is cool and sleak designed it's too good but inbuilt buttons are there so be gentle to it and keyboard keys are also soft and handy must say.Complimentary:-You will get a Microsoft ofgice 2019 student edition for lifetime more than sufficient even for many office works.And you get mc afee antivirus one year subscription free as well though mc afee isn't the best antivirus out there but it will help.Both are pre installed and for activation you just need to open and login to both.SoftwareSoftware is very good but again it's because ram that the software isn't that much effective.ProsLow price,ms office lifetime,mcafee one year,amd ryzen 3 and vega 3 integrated mobile graphics,180° rotate.ConsBattery,laggy,low gaming.

  Great for daily home use. Mine came with 4GB of memory, which is bare-minimum now to support modern web browsing. Google’s Chrome browser consumes a lot of memory, so go for 8GB if you have the option. The CPU seems speedy enough. My one honest annoyance is that, like many laptops, the screen tint appears slightly more bluish—white skews slightly blue. I didn’t see this on my old MacBook Pro, so it may just be a Windows issue with the available color profiles. I mentioned home use, because the top of the lid scratches easily, so taking this on the road would likely induce scratching from rough handling. The thing which I didn't like at all is the battery life, Its battery life is very low i.e. after full charging it survives only for 2-2.5 hrs with continuous use. I think its high time Lenovo should really focus on this particular thing.

  Warning* these are all faulty and refurbished products by Lenovo. Had my own tech guy check it out and it's obvious that they are all old faulty products, refurbished and sent to customer with the hoax of an ""offer price"". Lenovo is known for this, and it shows when you try to reach out to them for a replacement, they say the invoice is more than a week old and cannot be replaced even though the warranty is a year. Multiple emails and DM's later, they still won't respond for a replacement. The laptop hangs and freezes everytime as users have mentioned here. It doesn't want to connect to a WiFi connection and you always need to disable the adaptor every now and then. My suggestion, go for a Parle G laptop or a chor baazaar laptop, but stay away from Lenovo. I would even suggest Dell, but never Lenovo just for the fact that you would be paying full price for faulty and old products. Amazon is also part to blame for having such sellers who won't even bother to help customers once payment is done.

  I bought this laptop since my son needed one for his online classes.Got this Laptop delivered on June 22nd , setting up took 2-3 hours , but then the issues started. The laptop is extremely slow , launching a word doc takes 3-5 minutes . Logging into  MS Teams takes forever , failed to even suit the purpose it was bought for . My 9 year old ACER works much faster than this one.Logged a complaint with Amazon and the technical support person was good , but the issue still remains the same.Now waiting for the technical support person to visit physically and check the laptop . But seriously I would want  to return this and go for something better like HP or Dell.A mistake that I am regretting now.

  This is good laptop for office/daily use.For programming- there is a slowness with eclipse IDE & other dB connections but still works pretty well.Battery life is average for continues Netflix & online streaming (2-3 hrs). Apart from that battery life is good, close to 5-6 hours.Built quality is average, I personally would have liked more improvement in built quality.You get MS office suite 2019 & antivirus (1 year) with this laptop.This is not at all a gaming laptop.  The ryzon 3 processors & intel i3 6th gen are somewhere equal at performance barrier.  For the range of 25k-30k I found this is currently best laptop.Note: I wanted to use ryzon processor over intel.

  Software got corrupted after 7 months of use, but can understand that . However the real pain is getting their service centre guys to understand the problem. Different people gives different diagnostics and issue resolution tips. Nothing works. Finally they said they are not responsible for OS and reach out to Microsoft, that too under warranty.which I feel was a compleletely irresponsible way of dealing with a customer. So if you are a techie and can service your own laptops, go for it. If not pls don't. I had to shell out money from my pocket, when the product was still under warranty.

It is unbelievable, there are many defects with the basic design. when it is folded, the screen is touching the keypad and the impressions are now on the screen, just after 6 months of use.  one side of the outer margin of the screen is not properly resting while closing.  To add all to this, the system is very slow right from the beginning.  I am using programs like MS office but still, it is taking time just to open programs like MS Word.  should check if this has a warranty... I do not recommend this.

  All technical sides are worth money. Processor is quite slow though. I have bought recently & almost no softwares expect Office programs. It takes time while opening them. Its light and very stylish. While buying I opted for Office programmes and other installments (cause I dont know how to use Win 10). Other thing is its genuine product so it comes with Microsoft office 365 1 month free trial. After that if you dont buy full version trial version ends nd you cant use any of them. No DvD reader and no SD card reader. Technology is going advanced so old models have it this one does not.Budget friendly good laptop for students or office if you are not planning to do anything extra on it. For games or graphic softwares go for other models.

  Pathetic product. With Just MS Word open, no other app open, system starts hangs and  Memory usage reaches 92% and you won't be able to open any other application like Web Browser.Battery life mentioned is 9.5hrs but with just one application open its not giving 3hrs.When you raise a complaint to return the product they will simply refuse. They write ""Replacement within 7days"" but in that case also they will make you call Manufacturer, with no final result, you have to keep same product and keep following up with Customer care.Even if you want to go for higher version of Laptop like i5 or AMD , they will not allowed.I am 5+year old active customer with frequent buying behavior  and very low return rate, still they are not ready to support.As they have started fraudulent activity by selling product with wrong product description, it better to refrain yourself from buying on site, especially when it marked as ""replacement only"" as in this case they sell wrong products.

  I am writing this review after using it for 1 month .This is a very good purchase at this price point considering it's configurations.Though it also has some cons that i experiencedLet's talk in detailPros:1.

Sound of the speakers are so well which is usually absent in laptops at this price range8. The DELL brandCons .1. Display should be more brighter  , u may not have this issue if u are not a Netflix person but if u watch than u will definitely agree . Even in dark  with full brightness it seems less brighty2. Battery backup is not as described i.e. 10 hours  It only runs 4-5 hours , sometimes even less than  4 hrs3.

  Thanks to faster delivery by Amazon in 1 day during COVID19 lockdown. This is really awesome laptop from this price range ~37 K with having 256GB SSD + 1TB Hard Disk with Intel I3 10th Gen. The windows 10 is using SSD drive for faster booting and startup process.The battery charging is happening very fast. Overall performance of the system is very good. Struggling to activate office 2019 on this system for lifetimelifetime but after seeing some videos on YouTube I was able to install office 2019 on my system.

  I have always liked the sturdiness of the Dell Vostro series and Inspiron series. This laptop offers the right balance to be able to WFH.Pros:1. It has a 256 GB SSD and a 1 TB hard drive. Best Laptop to WFH with a 14 inch screen. The size and weight is perfect and the whole laptop feels sturdy.2. Sturdy laptop from a known brand.The screen brightness even at its highest setting does not glare at you. However, I read that a netflix user didn't feel it was adequate for long hours of viewing. I feel that this type of screen might actually help but its an individual preference.3. During first install, it said there's only an office trial and asked me for credit card details. Though disappointed, I decided to login and check. I was able to activate MS Office without paying extra. So, just skip the office trial instructions during first setup.4. Comes with 4 GB RAM but can be upgraded up to 16 GB if required later. Needs to be upgraded anyways.5. Came for about 33.5K using HDFC offers during the Great Amazon sale for Prime users. The next day, when I recommended it to friends, found out that the price had been bumped to 43K. Lucky to get this deal.Now Mi has introduced i3 35K laptops with 1500 credit card discounts. So, take your pick.For 43K you might want to go for MI i5 horizon Laptops or other more powerful laptops but its a personal choice.Cons:1. It is not a gaming laptop. At the same time, its a matte type of screen, hence you will not see the full sharpness in videos. May change with settings but this is my observation so far.2. The battery life stated is 10 hours but it gives around 4 - 6 hours depending on use.3.  Update after a few days of use, found that it lags a great deal when using VPN or Citrix. After a further investigation, found that it was a network/citrix issue and even by i5 lagged a lot but handled the situation a bit better than this i3 laptop. Hence, I would say that if you do not have Citrix issues, this is good for WFH as well.You can go for it since is a good budget option for students / WFH.

  I was very sceptical to buy this laptop after seeing so many negative reviews. Most of the people are facing mainly 2 problems 1. It is very slow and hangs. 2. Office is free for only one month. Office is lifetime free but not office 365, which is free for 1 month only. Many people don’t understand this difference and believe that they are being cheated. Now coming to the hanging issue, let me be very frank that I also faced this issue for 2 days and even decided to return the laptop. Luckily I realised that I am always getting one cloud app error. This app works only with office 365 and since I was using normal office, I decided to uninstall this app. After that I have not faced any hanging issue.

  out of the box it will work dead slow, u will think this config is not compatible with win 10, or there is some problem with the laptop,but after upgrading its window patches ( 3, 4 upgrades will take 2-- 3 hours )  and upgrade  all drivers from dell, it will work normally,advisable: disable mccafe antivirus,  and use windows defender, and close or uninstall unwanted apps and services from startup.its best performance can be get from a ssd version or with minimum  8gb ram,good part is, it has slot for ssd , and extra ram slot, it can be upgraded easily to add extra 8 gb ram and 256gb extra ssd, at around (4k ) ,i have not upgraded will do it later,i was ordering a ssd version , but somehow it get swapped to this one during final ordering as ssd was becoming out of stock every now and then,but due to amazon policy, we cannot return or change to another laptop, they can only replace with same model, if u have any issue.its advisable to buy a ssd version of this same laptop, or atleast 8gb ram varient.display : full hd ,great.thin and lightweight  ,body seemes durable,hinges are strong,battery backup: 4- 5 hours.windows 10 and office included.

  The product arrived ahead of time , the laptop in it’s original packing  was packed in an amazon box with no fillers to prevent it from getting tossed around .Infact the delivery boy was playing with it by flipping it inside when I went to the gate to receive it .The description says MS office however that is only a one month free trial version and one must buy the original at a price of 5 K ... I personally feel it’s misleading because windows 10 and ms office for our primary requirement when finalising the product .We have yet to transfer data from the other machine to this new one , on the surface of it looks fine , operates well .Will make another detailed review post 1 month use .

  My earlier two laptops were of HP. This is first time I opted n purchased Dell Vostro 3491. At this price range of 35-37 K its a marvelous machine. I have used it for about a week  for personal use n its ultimate. Let me give plus and minus:Plus: 1. Full HD, clear vision even at 178 degree.2. 1TB + 256 SSD which is extremely  fast in any processing activity.  Booting takes hardly 10 seconds.3. Clear and loud sound compared to other brands.nice speaker good for movies n web callings.4. 10th gen i3 processor fast n reliable for all your needs.5. Extremely slim n light Weight about 1.7 kg highly portable n easy handling.6. Spill resistance surface n easy grip outer portions thus better safety.7. Its Dell (India) a nice brand name with good online n otherwise support.8. Easy booting with finger print sensor. Well positioned n soft keys.Minus: 1. Need more brightness specially  while watching movies n videos. Other wise ok.2. Some time there is a delay in Bluetooth connectivity but not always.3. Though the company claims battery  back of 11 hrs but practically  it will give you 4-5 hrs only. But the charging is fast n doesn't  take longer time.Overall the minus are not that serious but Plus are all of high value. So go for it. It's excellent.

It just says it cant create Support request.I tried for remote support and there is no session.How the hell can I interact for support?Want to add more now. This is just useless when explorer doesnt open within 10 minutes. tried all options of optimization, trouble shoots etc. It is just unbearable. Dont get trapped by the price. It is not worth buying even at 10000 INR.

  Got the laptop recently. So far so good. Decent performance, quite suitable for students with less multi tasking requirements. Anti-glare screen is helpful for kids video schooling. Pre-loaded windows 10 and office is a definite plus.Remember you are buying core i3 (not i7) and hence will have to settle for slightly lesser speed.

  Worst product.Very very slow in function.It can't even handle basic Word and Excel files.I am writing this review after about 24 days of purchase from Amazon.Dell has simply cheated  by  launching this product.It's 4GB memory is worthless.This configuration is absolutely useless.Office 19 provided with it is not perfectly compatible with the OS in it.It hangs up every now and then while opening of Word and Excel files every single time.I requested Amazon and Dell to replace this faulty device.But they are not bothered at all.A poorly conceived and configured laptop.Its basic aim to cheat customers by showing inbuilt office 19 , Windows 10 with 1TB HD.Its all useless.I am finding difficulty even handling simple MS office functions.Dell customer services has admitted themselves in their response that with the provided 4GB RAM ; of which the OS occupies major portion makes it difficult for other works to function smoothly.Amazon support is nil.Dell support is pathetic.They (Dell) have lied repeatedly to look into the matter employing classic delaying tactics.It's a sheer waste of money.I am planning to move consumer court to put this case.Its very clear that Dell has intentionally put forward this product to market, fully knowing about its inefficacy only to somehow sell it.Its all about cheating, forgery and fraudulent trade practice.So it's a big No..No ..No from me.

  Today after first day of usage observed that battery life is not as per what is stated in product description, it's lasts only for 4 hours maximum. Hope it gets better day by day of usage. Should provide document about how to activate MS Office. Rest all features are excellent and as per the product description. Its value for Money for sure. The laptop body is finger magnet leaves behind lots of traces on the body. Good budget laptop overall. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome. Multi functional track pad is too good.

  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, I bought during the big billion day. The laptop is way too slow have been trying to get in touch with the customer services of Dell, they are saying there is a software issue. I tried to do whatever they asked me to do, I even took Holiday to finish the set up. Even after sitting for 7 hours they couldn't resolve when I asked them to send a service person or I'll visit the service center they are asking for money. Warranty is on hardware and not on software. I understand the policy but if the laptop is not letting me install the os isn't it their responsibility to get this fixed? Even after reinstalling os it is not responding, they are not ready to agree it is their fault. And for replacement they will take time off 45 days even for that they haven't confirmed if they will do it

  The laptop was extremely slow and the operating system crashed on the same day. Apps would take long time to open or screen became unresponsive. Even the booting was slow. In a brand new laptop without any downloaded files, this is surprisingly. A technician came and checked and said several people facing same issues. He said he'll report the problem and help with replacement. Surprisingly, Amazon told me he reported just the opposite. So beware of people checking your machines. They are least bothered in helping you. I am still waiting for resolution or a replacement or refund. Very disappointing experience.

  Many people have complained about the slowness of this laptop. Yes, it was very slow during the set up. With 4gb ram and 5400 rpn hdd inside, one should not expect blazing fast performance. After set up, I upgraded the ram to 12 gb and changed the 1 tb hdd to 500 gb ssd. The back cover is very easy to open and to my surprise the motherboard has 2 independent ram slots which can accommodate 2×8 gb ram modules. Many other laptops of Acer, Lenovo etc. have the ram unit inbuilt to the mother board which leaves only one slot for the user to upgrade. Mi laptops doesn't have any ram slots to upgrade. Though officially not declared, the slots can even support 2×16 gb modules as per certain upgrade advice sites. The 4gb ram provided is of 3200 mhz and not 2666 mhz as mentioned in the Dell website. Before upgrading, it will be better to confirm the ram frequency using softwares like cpuz to ensure proper matching. Only disappointment is that it doesn't have m2 ssd slot for upgrade. After the upgrade, the laptop is blazing fast and the performance is very good.

  I read alot of negative reviews and all of them belonged to the 1TB HDD version,then I read positive and all of them belonged to the 1TBHDD+256GBSSD.If you can squeeze a little more money, PLEASE go for the 1+256 version, the boot speed is blazing fast, the processing speed is good, writing the review after a week and no issues so far. For those who think Microsoft office isn't included *THAT'S NOT THE CASE* when windows takes you through the Setup process, please create an Outlook account and *USE THE SAME ID PASSWORD* for Office sign up.

You can go for this.(P.S. I've used the laptop strictly for light to medium work usage, I don't know if it can handle games but it has integrated Intel graphics and also a built in app that can tell what games it can take and also optimises gaming performance)

  What I liked: it has a huge storage space. Price tag is reasonable. Progamming software is in the SSD, so it starts up by about 15 secs, which is much quicker than those without SSD. Shutdown is even faster. No bloatware.My Dislikes,Extremely poor built!! Keyboard sags down with each keystroke...eeks!! Screen and keyboard are dirt magnets. There are much smaller sized 14 laptops in market, sizewise too its quite large for the screen size.Initially there were some screen problems.. amazon washed its hands off saying ""please contact Dell"". And its not easy to contact dell people! Luckily, blips on my screen resolved.. hope it says that way.

Windows10 needs SSD necessarily for running the system. Purchase the SSD model or Buy HHD model in lesser amount and upgrade it by your end to save upto 4-5k.Surely this will help!

It is so slow that im starting to lose my temper. The laptop design is very nice actually its very compact n all but the processing speed is very unusually slow.

  Laptop takes quite sometime to boot and be ready mainly because of the present hardware configuration. With addition of ssd or increase in RAM speed should increase as seen from comments of a better laptop that amazon offered later at a nominal higher price. In all amazon & dell managed to push a inferior product which they are offering at a lower price but not worth it. For light use such as myself the present configuration may work but thinking of increasing RAM to 8gb later. The bundled up windows and ms office were trial versions and was asked to pay an hefty sum for 1 year license

  Folks, I purchased this laptop only to realize that my previous laptop Celeron Dual Core Pentium processer was faster than this i3. My humble request is no to get carried away by the price and land in trouble.Secondly, Amazon played a clever trick, if you see the ratings, most of the 1 star was given for poor installation or service not done having paid Rs. 700/-  This was to distract the ratings from actual product review, which mean there are no reviews about the product. Misleading way to con customers. Boot time close to a minute, opening MS Teams add another minute... very very slow....

  The best laptop at this price range. With 256GB SSD, it has superb response. With 1 TB SATA disk, you don't need worry about Disk space to store anything. It is i3 (10th Gen) processor, but with SSD, it performs faster than i5 processor. Good camera, FHD screen and good battery life.Bought it for my daughter's online class, she is loving it.

  Sturdy laptop, gorgeous screen, amazingly smooth keyboard, pre-installed windows 10, free Office 2019 licence all at a great VFM price point, so ticks most boxes  but with one fatal flaw - 4gb RAM is simply not enough. Struggled with everything -booting, loading even simple programs, restart, updates, even browsing one tab on chrome.. thankfully there is an additional SODIMM slot so added 8gb additional RAM and now everything is great.GB

  The laptop looks good, this is the only positive thought I can think of. I have used this laptop for 3 days straight now. It hangs several times while performing basic operations like surfing the internet to just using a word or Excel sheet. Takes forever to boot. This configuration is not useful even if you intend to use it for entertainment or for a nline studies (for yourself or your kid's online classes). The sheer slow response and hanging will drive you crazy. I've raised a ticket with Dell support and following the guidance they've provided on chat (no calling option). They've requested me to run ""support assist"" and the device has hanged while doing the same. Honestly, my suggestion to anyone reading this is "" DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP"" no matter what any of the other positive comments say. My kind heads up to anyone planning to walk this path, just turn away, don't waste your time and money. Hope the review helps you.

  Bought this thinking that dell was a good brand and amazon was a trusted platform. the laptop is supposed to be loaded with MS office. When it came, it was msoffice was some kind of a cloud version. The new laptop was extremely slow. I intended to return it immediately but amazon said thats not possible. They will send someone to service it. The service guys called and said that they cant do anything about the speed. will need to upgrade the RAM. Nothing as such is mentioned in the product listing. Now its become even slower. Reminds me of assembled computers during my school days. Dell has lost it quality totally. And i had trusted amazon all these years. Used to by with my eyes shut.NOT ANYMORE... AMAZON you are not as good as before!!!

  Returned the next day, too slow. The memory was too low to have processes like chrome and excel. Vostro is supposed to be a business laptop, every process took so much of time to process in this laptop hence returned it. The return process was also not easy since amazon first replaces the product to another product and then finally return your money back after the second product is also returned. Seemed like a good deal at the proce but 4gb ram is a deal breaker. You may have to invest in another 4gb ram to make it work properly but then the total outlay goes high and there are many laptops available which give you a 8gb config

Call of duty Black ops all series at 30 -40 fps.For playing other titles you'd need GPU dedicated.It has fingerprint sensor too!Mic too! Core i3 10th gen processor with turbo boost technology.

  I've bought it recently and I'm kind of satisfied according to it's price range. The main and most satisfying feature is actually it's performance for that I bought it. Display is just okay, missing backlid keyboard is noticeable, speakers output is also okay and the most worthless feature of this laptop is it's battery life. Laptop's hinge is very hard while opening the lid, can't open with one hand. In specifications it was showed that it has inbuilt fast charging (but I didn't find that). I only bought it for performance & SSD and that I received. My headphone jack stopped working after single week of purchasing but that sometimes happens. And they are providing on-site warranty (GOOD).

  The Laptop is hanging even without running any applications. I reported Dell and they suggested to upgrade RAM.

  Lenovo laptops are ok as long as they are within warranty period. Once warranty period overs and if you face any issues with your laptop, be ready to suffer. Service centers are worst and they don't have spare parts available with them. They don't even prefer to work with out of warranty laptops. This is my personal experience with lenovo products. So if you are planning to buy lenovo laptops, keep this in mind.

  The device is great when it comes to built quality, performance, trackpad, etc. I specially love speakers and mainly the keyboard which has good travel and it's just a joy to type on. I also like the Chrome OS which is better than Windows when you are going for budget laptops as they work faster.But the real problem is the display, it's 720p which is good for the price, but it has colour shifting problem like an TN display. The white balance is out of this world and there is no option to change it on the chromebook. So you need to live with it. There are even times I need to bend and watch as I can't even see anything while siting in the normal position. This isn't just my device fault, this model's display is designed like that. So I am really really warning you to check the reviews on the web before buying, mainly about the display.

  It has been a week since this laptop was delivered to me and it has been performing well. However, if you are planning to use this laptop as your primary one I'd suggest to go for a windows laptop. Chromebooks are designed only for basic tasks and this is true for this chromebook too. Don't expect great performance while editing or gaming. If you are a person who's daily work involves only light browsing, video conferences and streaming videos, this laptop is just perfect for you.P.s. The touchscreen works nicely too.

  Excellent value for money product. I didn’t want to spend too much for a laptop, I needed it for some training’s which I couldn’t do on my office laptop due to restrictions etc. I have used the laptop to do some courses and for entertainment such as Netflix, amazon prime etc and am quite happy. Recently though, there was an update after which it seems that the laptops volume has gone down(which was much better to start with)! I hope this is temporary and future patches will fix it but let us hope. When I connect it to a Bluetooth speaker, it works perfect.

  This laptop is great for some basic tasks such as editing documents, making presentations, or basic web browsing. With the current ram capacity, it can't be used for high demanding tasks. It's pretty good at handling school tasks, basic office work though there are many places that Lenovo has cut corners in and that could have used improvement. It comes with an average battery life that you could expect given the size of the battery and the price point. Some flaws I noticed are the screen quality such as brightness, the really mediocre speakers, and the absolutely useless webcam. Basically, if you plan to have lot of video calls/online meetings I would avoid this laptop.Being a CS engineering student this laptop clearly won't be able to run programs such as Android Studio, Android emulator, etc. without any lag but this can be improved with the ram upgrade. However, this was bought for a cousin to assist in schoolwork as everything is moving online.Pros:*Good build quality. ( Plastic but good quality)*Port selection*Keyboard ( a joy to type in)*Inclusion of an SSD*MS Office inclusion*Lenovo Vantage SoftwareCons:*Screen ( Could have been brighter and of better quality)*Abysmal webcam*Speakers not up to par.*Battery life ( Not to bad though )I would recommend this laptop to people who have basic needs such as administration work, email checking, and schoolwork. Its priced pretty well for the specs it offers ( I was able to grab it at 35.5k + a bank offer), compared to its competitors. Maybe try upgrading the ram when u get it.Personally would wait for laptops with the new Ryzen 4000 series to get released if you are not in a rush or would wait for the price to drop again as its 38k at the time of writing.

  Overall it is a good Laptop for online classes and normal surfing. The camera quality and audio is below average. I would have been better if HDD was also included in the laptop along with SSD. There is no Ethernet Jack (LAN port). It is all plastic body and build quality is average. The good thing is that it comes with Windows 10 + MSOffice (Home and Student Edition).

   Honest review after a week.As seen in the video I posted laptop was laggy even with chorme and other low-resource intensive apps.It would hang if tried to open big games.Then I added 8gb of ram, and the laptop is now really smooth. Can play most games at 60fps at low-med settings and 40-60 fps at high settings.Multi-tasking is really smooth, not like before where 103% of ram was being by just using chrome.Pros:Keyboard is pretty good.Build quality is ok.Fan is pretty silent on idle works.Speakers sound kinda tinny but loud enough.Display is 1080p, and so it looks sharp.Cons:Display colours looks washed. (I did some tweaking with saturation, contrast and windows gamma correction, now I'm getting used to it).4gb ram is too low for this.I was planning to buy an SSD, but I'm doubting if I want to now.Overall after adding 8gb ram it's perfect for me, to play small games like Minecraft, Rocket league, Valo; and for media playback.

Both USB, Type C , HDMI all are at one side3. No Fingerprint Sensor or IR Camera for login using Windows Hello4. Most Important thing, you cannot install other Operating system in it. All you can do is create a Recovery pendrive and use it to reset your Windows 10 home to factory reset.

  I bought the laptop from Amazon and I just have to say something is wrong with the laptop because it doesn't work properly and I just used it for a day. It's extremely slow, the apps don't work properly and stops responding and minute and it's causing me alot of trouble. I have called hp customer service and talked to the agent but they were not able to help either. The apps don't appear on the taskbar after starting the laptop, it takes them more than a minute to come. And the audio also stops anytime. And when the last time I tried opening it, the system said the pin is not working and told me to install a app for the same. I have also called a technician from Amazon and they'll look into it but I just have to say that I didn't expect this from hp. It is causing great inconvenience to me.

  I purchased this laptop and giving review after using it for almost a monthNo doubt the Laptop is very good with such a configuration but let me talk about the cons1.No Ethernet Port2. Both USB, Type C , HDMI all are at one side3. No Fingerprint Sensor or IR Camera for login using Windows Hello4. Most Important thing, you cannot install other Operating system in it. All you can do is create a Recovery pendrive and use it to reset your Windows 10 home to factory reset.

  To all the people who were not able to scan the whatapp QRcode in their laptops. Pls uninstall the iris Xe graphics (without deleting the driver software for the device) and then reinstall it by clicking the ""scan for hardware changes "", so ur driver will be reinstalled as well as the Qrcode will now be able to help u access whatapp web in your laptop.NOTE:It's just a temporary solution, once you logout again the same situation arise,Maybe we have to wait for driver updation, till then if u don't logout from ur system things are set!*****************************************************APART FROM THAT, EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL SO FAR WITH THIS PRODUCT*****************************************************

  I bought the laptop from Amazon and I just have to say something is wrong with the laptop because it doesn't work properly and I just used it for a day. It's extremely slow, the apps don't work properly and stops responding and minute and it's causing me alot of trouble. I have called hp customer service and talked to the agent but they were not able to help either. The apps don't appear on the taskbar after starting the laptop, it takes them more than a minute to come. And the audio also stops anytime. And when the last time I tried opening it, the system said the pin is not working and told me to install a app for the same. I have also called a technician from Amazon and they'll look into it but I just have to say that I didn't expect this from hp. It is causing great inconvenience to me.

  The laptop is good. Have been using it for a day and things work as expected. Purchased it for 55k. Unfortunately I had a bad experience with the seller for this item. I don't think anyone properly checks what he is dispatching. The laptop that arrived was already used. Packing of latop and charger were all over the place. Dirty fingerprints all over the laptop. Switched the laptop ON and it said no Operating system installed, which was kind of funny. So it was basically a paperweight worth 55k.Amazon team was hepful to arrange a replacement. But the seller took his own sweet time of like 8-10 days to deliver the replacement laptop. And this is inspire of me being a Amazon Prime customer. In today's times, sitting without a working laptop is akin to doing nothing. So yes, had a lot of mental. Tension and pressure while the laptop was arriving. I had a not so good experience with the seller.

  Though on the costlier side, the benefits of i5 negates it all. Amazon needs to ensure the package is sturdy. The tape on the side was tampered with and there were marks of sharp objects used on the backside resulting in holes in the cardboard box. Thankfully nothing happened to the laptop inside.

  When I tried to register on Lenovo website it said the product is already registered and I have just 8 months of warranty remaining, basically it's a used product, used for at least 4 months.Pros:1. Good battery life, 6-8 hours2. Full laptop experience in small size3. The internal GPU, Intel UHD 600, is good enough to decode 4k@60fps, but somehow the browsers don't use it properly (may be windows issues or the drivers), downloaded files play smoothly in VLC, but browser can't handle 4k (there are frame drops)4. You get keyboard and active pen in the boxCons:1. Not anti glare screen2. It's 1280x800 screen, not FHD3. Without keyboard attached you can't use USB, as both USBs are in the keyboard4. Even without keyboard it feels heavy5. Huge bezels6. No ethernet port7. No HDMI port8. The screen is a fingerprint magnet, you'll need a screen protectorOkayish cameras.It will take sometime to be used to the keyboard, it's small with low key travel.You can access the boot menu by pressing fn+f12.It is possible to run Linux but issues with screen orientation and touchscreen will give you hard time. I tried installing linux (Ubuntu and Manjaro) it booted and installed successfully, by default they boot in portrait mode, you can rotate the screen from settings, but it doesn't rotate the touch, Manjaro sometimes caused black screen during screen rotation. Overall, you can install linux but you'll have hard time using the touchscreen.Buy if you want to do basic things like editing office files, browsing, watching videos. It's not made for gaming, video editing, programming etc.Update to windows 10 20H2 and use debloat scripts after that performance will be better.

  The bezel of the screen is quite large that minimise the display. But the display is quite good with a 24bit. And the touch responsive is also good. I am disappointed with this as i cannot run Adobe Indesign with it. But the ms office responsive is very good. The battery life is also great. The keypad though needs time to adebt to our huge fingers. Over-all this product is a great replacement to the ms surface-pro.

  When I tried to register on Lenovo website it said the product is already registered and I have just 8 months of warranty remaining, basically it's a used product, used for at least 4 months.Pros:1. Good battery life, 6-8 hours2. Full laptop experience in small size3. The internal GPU, Intel UHD 600, is good enough to decode 4k@60fps, but somehow the browsers don't use it properly (may be windows issues or the drivers), downloaded files play smoothly in VLC, but browser can't handle 4k (there are frame drops)4. You get keyboard and active pen in the boxCons:1. Not anti glare screen2. It's 1280x800 screen, not FHD3. Without keyboard attached you can't use USB, as both USBs are in the keyboard4. Even without keyboard it feels heavy5. Huge bezels6. No ethernet port7. No HDMI port8. The screen is a fingerprint magnet, you'll need a screen protectorOkayish cameras.It will take sometime to be used to the keyboard, it's small with low key travel.You can access the boot menu by pressing fn+f12.It is possible to run Linux but issues with screen orientation and touchscreen will give you hard time. I tried installing linux (Ubuntu and Manjaro) it booted and installed successfully, by default they boot in portrait mode, you can rotate the screen from settings, but it doesn't rotate the touch, Manjaro sometimes caused black screen during screen rotation. Overall, you can install linux but you'll have hard time using the touchscreen.Buy if you want to do basic things like editing office files, browsing, watching videos. It's not made for gaming, video editing, programming etc.Update to windows 10 20H2 and use debloat scripts after that performance will be better.

  NOTE:@ There's NO option to upgrade the RAM, it is FIXED !!!@ Storage used is SSD SATA 3 and NOT NVME, so speed will be limited to max 500mbps.@ There's NO SD card slot.@ Battery backup is max 6 hours. ( check the complete details below )I have being using this laptop for a complete week now and following are the observations,●● BUILT QUALITY ●●-------------------------➼  It has impressive built compared to the price and competitors in the segment.➼  Has Metal chassis and still is relatively light in weight.➼  Speakers has average output, nothing phenomenal.➼  Connectivity is disappointment as there's NO SD card slot, Type C port; RJ-45 jack is also absent, though I didn't felt any need for it in a week.➼  There's NO in-built webcam, which is bummer. You have to physical install it every time when needed, which also consumes 1 USB port unnecessarily.➼  Finally, it looks good, but having more color option, especially black would have being great.●● DISPLAY ●●------------------➼ Its a 14 inch FHD anti-glare LED display, which has decent viewing angles.➼ Colour production is above average.➼ Contrast is average.➼ Auto brightness adjustment and no control whatsoever.* Its not a touch screen (just a note)●● SYSTEM PERFORMANCE ●●------------------------------------➼ System speed is faster than conventional HDD devices, but its mediocre when compared to nvme devices, which is new normal in this segment.➼ Light to medium games runs smoothly. Heavy games like GTA V & NFS Heat, too run on low to medium graphics, but Thermals are always sky high. With these thermals, I don't think laptop will survive even a month.So in short, its NOT a proper gaming machine. You can enjoy the light games though. ➼ Video editing on Adobe premiere pro is seamless, office softwares works smoothly too. So you can use it for productivity, but absence of Numpad is felt every second when you are using it for productivity.➼ Its indeed a good device for media consumption like online movies,etc as well as locally stored movies and web browsing. I didn't faces any issues yet, but RAM consumption was constantly in the range of 70-80%.➼ Finally touchpad is smooth and support multi gestures, which is in synonymous with windows 10.●● Battery backup ●●-------------------------# Charging takes less than 90 mins from 0 to 100 %# Supports Fast charge of 0 to 50 % in 30 mins.Following are backup data observed,➼ On 50% brightness (B) with web browsing is upto 5.5 hours.➼ On 50 B with editing or gaming is upto 4 hours.➼ On watching movies online at 50B is upto 5 to 5.5 hours.➼ On watching movies locally at 50-70B is upto  6  hours.●●●● VERDICT ●●●●------------------------This could have being the perfect laptop, but its NOT. It already has specs which are in the range of 50-60k machines like metal chassis, i5 10th gen processor, MX250 gpu, decent battery backup. But limitation on RAM upgrade and SSD SATA 3 type, are too significant to neglect.I will personally opt for laptop with NVME SSD and upgradable RAM, even if it doesn't have MX250 or metal chassis, as like any typical Indian consumer I will invests into laptop to retain it for least 2-3 years. And looking at the media consumption level and softwares evolving these days, 8GB RAM  and 600mbps SSD is certainly going to struggle in a year max.So if you have 48k at disposal and don't bother for higher system performance, and want a laptop for normal media consumption, then go ahead with this. But if you are like me, an typical Indian consumer which prefers performance in long run, then stay away from this. There are better alternatives to this like Asus vivobook 14, Lenovo Slim 3i, Acer swift 3, etc.Hope this help you make sound purchase decision.

  *Mac air 2017 to mi notebook 14! Why? *1. Same awesome build quality with extra HDMI port.2. MS office 2019 professional downloaded for free from youtube. It works awesome. In MAC, windows things doesn't work properly and also pandrive/external drive issues while transferring from windows/Mac.3.Display is just top notch in comparison to mac17. Also the bezel less display made the 14 inch screen fit into same 13 inch space of Mac.4. Windows games. Yes this mx250 2gb graphic card can handle gaming not the big idiotic ones but the one we professionals play while doing work. Like asphalt 8,9, fifa 14-16, GTA 5 and other small games too without affecting the 8gb ram.5. Keyboard is feel good and comparable to mac. touch pad is precise but could have been better build but no complaints.6. Sound is not good but mi provided dts audio processing app which makes it comparable to mac.7. It has so many modes battery saver to performance. Battery charge in 50 mins and battery consumption is comparable to MacBook.8. Biggest i5 10 gen is snappier way faster, smoother and battery efficient.Overall better than Mac air 17

  Update after 10 weeks:====Spilled full glass of sprite on the keyboard. BIOS stopped recognizing the HDD. Took it to MI service center immediately. Engineer cleaned things up and said he will check later as he wanted all parts to fully dry.And they don't have all parts since this is a new product. They procured some parts to see which one was the problem, but by the time parts arrived (1 week), the service engineer cleaned up the laptop inside and kept it aside. And magically, everything started to work again.Not sure if I was lucky, or the laptop is somewhat liquid resistant. I am still happy with the solid build quality. Except for the missing built-in webcam, rest everything I got used to. Don't see them as problems anymore.Update after 2 weeks:========Weak speakers. No webcam is a deal breaker. Much harder to manage with external webcam than I imagined.If you are buying this, assuming you don't have issue with chinese products, the other option is honor magic book. Better bang for the buck. webcam, fingerprint reader and usb-c charging.If you are playing safe, and want to have peace of mind for after sales service etc, go for HP/Lenovo/Dell/Asus. Asus has a vivobook 14 in this price range, and it has webcam, fingerprint reader and backlit keyboard. Both Honor and Mi are new entrants to notebook space in India and not sure what will be their support story 2-3 years from now.=========Like:1) Unibody metal build quality. Feels sturdy in hand compared to similarly priced laptops2) Fast startup, SSD, i5 10th gen, and 8GB ram helps.3) Bright HD Screen4) Battery life and fast charging5) Value for moneyDislike:1) RAM not upgradable2) External webcam3) No backlit keyboard4) Trackpad feels cheap5) Laptop body gets scratched easily6) No USB-C port(for charging and docking)Not sure:1) Mi after sales support2) Repair costs if something goes wrong with laptop

  I wanted fast and light laptop and this is best laptop I could find in this price.There isn't back lit keyboard or finger touch unlock but I knew that when I bought this. If you have other Mi devices you can connect with it. I have Mi band and on connecting it with the laptop, I don't have to enter password to unlock it which was best feature and it balanced lack of finger touch unlock for me.Laptop opens in seconds and best thing battery last for more than 15 hours. I'm a blogger and my usage is lot more.  I don't shut down laptop whenever I'm not using it, I just lock screen and still it lasts full day for me and only have to charge once a day. It gets fully charged in an hour.Screen is awesome. Some said it is too bright for night time but if you turn on reading mode it wouldn't bother much.I'm using it for 2 weeks and so far I love the experience.

  This laptop has a very impressive look. I received this item 2 days before. Since then this item is running good. i'm sharing somethings about this laptop( purely my opinion ) :pros:1) DISPLAY: The quality of it's screen is very very very good. the resolution of the screen is so high that you can really enjoy your movies & videos at 4K quality. This laptop comes with an ANTI GLARE DISPLAY and I think this anti glare display with that type of high resolution is the most impressive thing in this price range.2) BATTERY: Now what to say about its battery! just one thing to say for its battery - AMAZING. It can easily run 6-8 hours based on your using.3) PERFORMENCE: If you are a student or someone who use laptops for light work and light gaming then this laptop is just made for you. It really gives a smooth performance .4) AUDIO QUALITY: Fabulous, Amazing, Wonderful …. don't worry about it's sound system. it is best in this price range.5) CHARGING SPEED: It don't take a long time to be charged. it is quite fast in my laptop< 0-60 percent in 48 minutes>6) DESIGN: DESIGN OF THIS LAPTOP IS COMPATABLE WITH MAC BOOK. So just awesome.7) TOUCHPAD: This is very good in my laptop. I'm feeling more comfortable with this touchpad than mouse. but I would recommend to keep a wireless mouse with you if you are not familiar with touchpads.CONS:1) CAMERA: THE QUALITY IS NOT GOOD OF THIS CAMERA. You should buy a new webcam if you are a student and very much depended on online class.2) ABSENCE OF FINGER PRINT SENSOR: THIS ALSO QUITE DISSAPOINTED. IN THIS PRICE RANGE MI IS NOT OFFERING A FINGER PRINT SENSOR WITH ITS LAPTOP. You can get a finger print sensor on Honor MAGICBOOK 14.3) SATA SSD: It comes with sata ssd . It would be better if MI offered a PCLe SSD (NVMe SSD) .OVERALL VIEW: IT A VERY GOOD OPTION FOR STUDENTS AND LIGHT WORKING PERSONS. BEFORE USING THIS LAPTOP DON'T FORGOT TO INSTALL AN ANTIVIRUS. IT WILL HELP YOU TO PROTECT YOUR LAPTOP  FROM VIRUSES AND MALWARES. RUN YOUR LAPTOP ON BEST PERFORMENCE MODE, TURNING ON BATTERY SAVER MODE COULD MAKE PRESSURE ON YOUR CPU..... SO THATS ALL.  THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEW. I WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW AFTER ONE MONTH OF USING THIS LAPTOP. TILL THEN STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY.

  Purchased the i5-NvidiaMX250 + webcam bundle from Amazon for 50k. Don’t know why it has split the products into 2 when trying to review although it was a bundle purchase. Anyway, here’s a very detailed review after 1 week of usage.Best part about the laptop – the BUILD. It’s a stunning metal body silver build which is just awesome and looks premium. No MI badging on the front. It looks really neat and chic. I clearly remember seeing this in an MI store in 2017/18 and just loved the build so much back then. I asked the sales executive, how much does this cost? And he said “Sir, this is not for sale. In fact this is not available in India right now and it may not be available any time soon.” 3 years later, here we have it in the very same build and form. 😊Additional plus point- Only 1.5kg; although most of the sleek laptops these days come with a similar or ever lesser weight, this one is quite sleek and pretty easy to handle single-handedly. Edges all across are metal framed and just brilliant. Absolutely robust.PROS – Let’s talk about the pros first.- This is the cheapest spec and config (with SSD & Nvidia GPU) you can get in this price compared to what is there in market.  It’s actually some good pieces of hardware at this price.- The display is fabulous in terms of anti-glare. I sit under a bright white tube light and it really does not strain my eye. The rest is what you can expect from a normal FHD screen. Nothing special. Display does seem a little vivid though. White is white and appears true to the term.- NO bloatware. MI just has a couple of softwares from the MI stack installed and thankfully, there is not much extra unwanted stuff. So, you don’t have to kill all the extras from Task Manager.- Battery time is pretty good. I’m not really sure it can last twelve hours with multimedia and gaming, but from a work perspective, the battery goes really long. In my first stint for work (with many softwares open and low brightness), it went beyond 6 hours with no charging from 80-90%.- The charging is really quick. I haven’t really cross checked on what MI claims about fast charging, but the charging is really super quick. I found it faster than my i7 work laptop even when it was brand new. Would have to wait and watch as the battery degrades with time.- SSD – This is SATA SSD. SATA SSD by default is faster than the conventional SATA (HDD) by nearly 10 times and NVMe SSD claims to be faster than SATA SSD by nearly 4 times. However, trust me, in today’s world, YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED A SSD DRIVE. I can’t even think of working on a HDD drive. Trust me people, there is a massive difference. When I upgraded to SSD on my old laptop, it was like upgrading to 5th gear from 1st gear. NVMe SSD is faster, agreed, but even SATA SSD is not bad, although I feel, there is not much of a price difference, MI should have put in NVMe, but I’m not complaining. (The horizon versions of MI laptops have NVMe SSDs).  BUT SSD (instead of HDD) IS NEEDED. PERIOD.- NOT A HARDCORE GAMING Laptop – So don’t expect this to be a super clocked gaming laptop. Nowhere does MI mention that. It’s pretty ok for games on the default settings and this one has Nvidia MX250. Should be ok for average and part time gamers. Haven’t really tried heavy games though. Remember, gaming laptops are different in the way they are configured specially with the GPU, cooling, ventilation and processor speed.- Multimedia is decent. This has DTS sound which makes some difference to the sound output compared to conventional sound. You can configure it your way with the pre-installed DTS Audio Processing app. I really think it’s almost similar to DOLBY ATMOS. DTS uses a higher bit rate though.- 8 GB RAM is quite adequate for almost everything unless you are a hardcore gamer.- One thing that people don’t mention is the surface grip. It has 2 horizontal rubber strips at the base which really hold the laptop well in its place, even when you tilt the table a bit. Doesn’t slide easily even if the surface is slippery which is quite good.- Did not experience heating at all. With all possible office softwares loaded which are still heavy on CPU and RAM, there was not much heating even while charging. Movies, music did not cause heating. Even running a game like ASPHALT did not heat it that much, though only ran it for some time. Prolonged gaming will surely cause heating as is the case with all machines. But this has plenty of heat ventilation slots at the bottom.- Thankfully, there’s only 1 sticker on the laptop and that’s a small i5 sticker and it’s neat and silver in colour. I just hated it when laptops put so many stickers like processor, GPU, sound etc. on the wrist panel.- The keyboard keys are well spaced just like a 15.6” laptop. So, if you’re used to typing on a 15.6” laptop like me, you wouldn’t notice any difference. I have seen horrible key spacing in some 14” laptops, but this one is pretty good.- Touchpad feels good. Supports multi-finger touch.- Another plus is the hinge mechanism. I found it pretty sturdy and tough and does not vibrate at all when you pull up the hood and release it. Let’s see how it gets with age.CONS – Yes it has CONS as well- I just dont like the new setups where the power button is on the top right of the keypad. I am used to the DELETE button being there. So pressed the power button accidentally many times.- The RAM and GPU cannot be upgraded. The RAM is fixed at 8 GB and so is the GPU. You cannot upgrade these. In fact, I believe these are factory attached to the motherboard and are non-detachable.- Webcam comes separately. Quality of the webcam is average, but can you imagine in this day and age, a separate webcam and not an inbuilt one. The worst part is it occupies one USB slot and is corded. If you don’t use a webcam, good for you.- The speakers are at the bottom. This is absolutely ludicrous. There’s so much of space on the top. The volume on full 100% is just so average like the laptops that were available 10+ years ago. Only the person sitting in front of the laptop can hear from the laptop speakers even in full volume. This is a disappointment, although I use earphones most of the times. Had the speakers been on top or sides, volume output would have been better.- The UP-DOWN keys are very important for all activities and they are really cramped on this keypad. MI should have configured these as full buttons, but most 14” have it similar.Other things worth mentioning- No Ethernet port, only 3 USD pots, 1 audio jack and 1 HDMI port- NO TYPE C / Thunderbolt port. NO SD Card reader port either TYPE C is there on the I7 version, but not there here.- No DVD drive or any optical drive.- The SSD somehow seems slower than expected when copying or writing. Could be a temporary thing.- The 30 day MS Office 365 trial is such a nothing. Microsoft themselves offer a 30 day trial for 365. Just that it’s installed on the machine.- USB 3.0 HDD with USB 3.0 cable with USB 3.0 port - file transfer to laptop seemed slower than expected. Again, could be a temporary thing.- The charging light is on the other side of the power cable slot.- NO backlight. Keypad has only 2 LEDs – one for the power button and one for CAPS LOCK.- Even with nothing open and all the extras shut, 4 GB RAM is consumed. :S- There are a couple of MI apps for instant wake up and fast data transfer with android phone. Haven’t tried those.CONCLUSION- If you want pure looks and a decent hardware, go for it. Looks are top class. Runs equally well. Plastic to metal is a big-big feel good factor and it’s really thin.- If you are hardcore gamer, DO NOT BOTHER about this one. It’s not for you.- Even average and part time gamers can consider this.- If you are anything other than a hardcode gamer, there is no reason to look for a competitor at this price. It is the cheapest in its segment. The base processor speed at 1.6 Ghz, Nvidia MX250, 512 GB SSD, 8 GB RAM are quite a configuration.- The battery life is awesome for WORK and multimedia.- Also, the RAM is not upgradeable, but honestly, have you really ever worked on something more than 8 GB? My office laptop is 16GB, but I just don’t find any difference in performance with respect to RAM.- MI Customer service has really improved over the years. However, answering you queries on phone is a different thing than getting your machine repaired. I’ve heard it takes time at the service centre. And anything classified by them as “damage”, has to be paid by you.PS: I have only used i5 laptops and higherGood luck with your purchase..

  NOTE:@ There's NO option to upgrade the RAM, it is FIXED !!!@ Storage used is SSD SATA 3 and NOT NVME, so speed will be limited to max 500mbps.@ There's NO SD card slot.@ Battery backup is max 6 hours. ( check the complete details below )I have being using this laptop for a complete week now and following are the observations,●● BUILT QUALITY ●●-------------------------➼  It has impressive built compared to the price and competitors in the segment.➼  Has Metal chassis and still is relatively light in weight.➼  Speakers has average output, nothing phenomenal.➼  Connectivity is disappointment as there's NO SD card slot, Type C port; RJ-45 jack is also absent, though I didn't felt any need for it in a week.➼  There's NO in-built webcam, which is bummer. You have to physical install it every time when needed, which also consumes 1 USB port unnecessarily.➼  Finally, it looks good, but having more color option, especially black would have being great.●● DISPLAY ●●------------------➼ Its a 14 inch FHD anti-glare LED display, which has decent viewing angles.➼ Colour production is above average.➼ Contrast is average.➼ Auto brightness adjustment and no control whatsoever.* Its not a touch screen (just a note)●● SYSTEM PERFORMANCE ●●------------------------------------➼ System speed is faster than conventional HDD devices, but its mediocre when compared to nvme devices, which is new normal in this segment.➼ Light to medium games runs smoothly. Heavy games like GTA V & NFS Heat, too run on low to medium graphics, but Thermals are always sky high. With these thermals, I don't think laptop will survive even a month.So in short, its NOT a proper gaming machine. You can enjoy the light games though. ➼ Video editing on Adobe premiere pro is seamless, office softwares works smoothly too. So you can use it for productivity, but absence of Numpad is felt every second when you are using it for productivity.➼ Its indeed a good device for media consumption like online movies,etc as well as locally stored movies and web browsing. I didn't faces any issues yet, but RAM consumption was constantly in the range of 70-80%.➼ Finally touchpad is smooth and support multi gestures, which is in synonymous with windows 10.●● Battery backup ●●-------------------------# Charging takes less than 90 mins from 0 to 100 %# Supports Fast charge of 0 to 50 % in 30 mins.Following are backup data observed,➼ On 50% brightness (B) with web browsing is upto 5.5 hours.➼ On 50 B with editing or gaming is upto 4 hours.➼ On watching movies online at 50B is upto 5 to 5.5 hours.➼ On watching movies locally at 50-70B is upto  6  hours.●●●● VERDICT ●●●●------------------------This could have being the perfect laptop, but its NOT. It already has specs which are in the range of 50-60k machines like metal chassis, i5 10th gen processor, MX250 gpu, decent battery backup. But limitation on RAM upgrade and SSD SATA 3 type, are too significant to neglect.I will personally opt for laptop with NVME SSD and upgradable RAM, even if it doesn't have MX250 or metal chassis, as like any typical Indian consumer I will invests into laptop to retain it for least 2-3 years. And looking at the media consumption level and softwares evolving these days, 8GB RAM  and 600mbps SSD is certainly going to struggle in a year max.So if you have 48k at disposal and don't bother for higher system performance, and want a laptop for normal media consumption, then go ahead with this. But if you are like me, an typical Indian consumer which prefers performance in long run, then stay away from this. There are better alternatives to this like Asus vivobook 14, Lenovo Slim 3i, Acer swift 3, etc.Hope this help you make sound purchase decision.

  *Mac air 2017 to mi notebook 14! Why? *1. Same awesome build quality with extra HDMI port.2. MS office 2019 professional downloaded for free from youtube. It works awesome. In MAC, windows things doesn't work properly and also pandrive/external drive issues while transferring from windows/Mac.3.Display is just top notch in comparison to mac17. Also the bezel less display made the 14 inch screen fit into same 13 inch space of Mac.4. Windows games. Yes this mx250 2gb graphic card can handle gaming not the big idiotic ones but the one we professionals play while doing work. Like asphalt 8,9, fifa 14-16, GTA 5 and other small games too without affecting the 8gb ram.5. Keyboard is feel good and comparable to mac. touch pad is precise but could have been better build but no complaints.6. Sound is not good but mi provided dts audio processing app which makes it comparable to mac.7. It has so many modes battery saver to performance. Battery charge in 50 mins and battery consumption is comparable to MacBook.8. Biggest i5 10 gen is snappier way faster, smoother and battery efficient.Overall better than Mac air 17

  Update after 10 weeks:====Spilled full glass of sprite on the keyboard. BIOS stopped recognizing the HDD. Took it to MI service center immediately. Engineer cleaned things up and said he will check later as he wanted all parts to fully dry.And they don't have all parts since this is a new product. They procured some parts to see which one was the problem, but by the time parts arrived (1 week), the service engineer cleaned up the laptop inside and kept it aside. And magically, everything started to work again.Not sure if I was lucky, or the laptop is somewhat liquid resistant. I am still happy with the solid build quality. Except for the missing built-in webcam, rest everything I got used to. Don't see them as problems anymore.Update after 2 weeks:========Weak speakers. No webcam is a deal breaker. Much harder to manage with external webcam than I imagined.If you are buying this, assuming you don't have issue with chinese products, the other option is honor magic book. Better bang for the buck. webcam, fingerprint reader and usb-c charging.If you are playing safe, and want to have peace of mind for after sales service etc, go for HP/Lenovo/Dell/Asus. Asus has a vivobook 14 in this price range, and it has webcam, fingerprint reader and backlit keyboard. Both Honor and Mi are new entrants to notebook space in India and not sure what will be their support story 2-3 years from now.=========Like:1) Unibody metal build quality. Feels sturdy in hand compared to similarly priced laptops2) Fast startup, SSD, i5 10th gen, and 8GB ram helps.3) Bright HD Screen4) Battery life and fast charging5) Value for moneyDislike:1) RAM not upgradable2) External webcam3) No backlit keyboard4) Trackpad feels cheap5) Laptop body gets scratched easily6) No USB-C port(for charging and docking)Not sure:1) Mi after sales support2) Repair costs if something goes wrong with laptop

  I wanted fast and light laptop and this is best laptop I could find in this price.There isn't back lit keyboard or finger touch unlock but I knew that when I bought this. If you have other Mi devices you can connect with it. I have Mi band and on connecting it with the laptop, I don't have to enter password to unlock it which was best feature and it balanced lack of finger touch unlock for me.Laptop opens in seconds and best thing battery last for more than 15 hours. I'm a blogger and my usage is lot more.  I don't shut down laptop whenever I'm not using it, I just lock screen and still it lasts full day for me and only have to charge once a day. It gets fully charged in an hour.Screen is awesome. Some said it is too bright for night time but if you turn on reading mode it wouldn't bother much.I'm using it for 2 weeks and so far I love the experience.

  This laptop has a very impressive look. I received this item 2 days before. Since then this item is running good. i'm sharing somethings about this laptop( purely my opinion ) :pros:1) DISPLAY: The quality of it's screen is very very very good. the resolution of the screen is so high that you can really enjoy your movies & videos at 4K quality. This laptop comes with an ANTI GLARE DISPLAY and I think this anti glare display with that type of high resolution is the most impressive thing in this price range.2) BATTERY: Now what to say about its battery! just one thing to say for its battery - AMAZING. It can easily run 6-8 hours based on your using.3) PERFORMENCE: If you are a student or someone who use laptops for light work and light gaming then this laptop is just made for you. It really gives a smooth performance .4) AUDIO QUALITY: Fabulous, Amazing, Wonderful …. don't worry about it's sound system. it is best in this price range.5) CHARGING SPEED: It don't take a long time to be charged. it is quite fast in my laptop< 0-60 percent in 48 minutes>6) DESIGN: DESIGN OF THIS LAPTOP IS COMPATABLE WITH MAC BOOK. So just awesome.7) TOUCHPAD: This is very good in my laptop. I'm feeling more comfortable with this touchpad than mouse. but I would recommend to keep a wireless mouse with you if you are not familiar with touchpads.CONS:1) CAMERA: THE QUALITY IS NOT GOOD OF THIS CAMERA. You should buy a new webcam if you are a student and very much depended on online class.2) ABSENCE OF FINGER PRINT SENSOR: THIS ALSO QUITE DISSAPOINTED. IN THIS PRICE RANGE MI IS NOT OFFERING A FINGER PRINT SENSOR WITH ITS LAPTOP. You can get a finger print sensor on Honor MAGICBOOK 14.3) SATA SSD: It comes with sata ssd . It would be better if MI offered a PCLe SSD (NVMe SSD) .OVERALL VIEW: IT A VERY GOOD OPTION FOR STUDENTS AND LIGHT WORKING PERSONS. BEFORE USING THIS LAPTOP DON'T FORGOT TO INSTALL AN ANTIVIRUS. IT WILL HELP YOU TO PROTECT YOUR LAPTOP  FROM VIRUSES AND MALWARES. RUN YOUR LAPTOP ON BEST PERFORMENCE MODE, TURNING ON BATTERY SAVER MODE COULD MAKE PRESSURE ON YOUR CPU..... SO THATS ALL.  THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEW. I WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW AFTER ONE MONTH OF USING THIS LAPTOP. TILL THEN STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY.

  Purchased the i5-NvidiaMX250 + webcam bundle from Amazon for 50k. Don’t know why it has split the products into 2 when trying to review although it was a bundle purchase. Anyway, here’s a very detailed review after 1 week of usage.Best part about the laptop – the BUILD. It’s a stunning metal body silver build which is just awesome and looks premium. No MI badging on the front. It looks really neat and chic. I clearly remember seeing this in an MI store in 2017/18 and just loved the build so much back then. I asked the sales executive, how much does this cost? And he said “Sir, this is not for sale. In fact this is not available in India right now and it may not be available any time soon.” 3 years later, here we have it in the very same build and form. 😊Additional plus point- Only 1.5kg; although most of the sleek laptops these days come with a similar or ever lesser weight, this one is quite sleek and pretty easy to handle single-handedly. Edges all across are metal framed and just brilliant. Absolutely robust.PROS – Let’s talk about the pros first.- This is the cheapest spec and config (with SSD & Nvidia GPU) you can get in this price compared to what is there in market.  It’s actually some good pieces of hardware at this price.- The display is fabulous in terms of anti-glare. I sit under a bright white tube light and it really does not strain my eye. The rest is what you can expect from a normal FHD screen. Nothing special. Display does seem a little vivid though. White is white and appears true to the term.- NO bloatware. MI just has a couple of softwares from the MI stack installed and thankfully, there is not much extra unwanted stuff. So, you don’t have to kill all the extras from Task Manager.- Battery time is pretty good. I’m not really sure it can last twelve hours with multimedia and gaming, but from a work perspective, the battery goes really long. In my first stint for work (with many softwares open and low brightness), it went beyond 6 hours with no charging from 80-90%.- The charging is really quick. I haven’t really cross checked on what MI claims about fast charging, but the charging is really super quick. I found it faster than my i7 work laptop even when it was brand new. Would have to wait and watch as the battery degrades with time.- SSD – This is SATA SSD. SATA SSD by default is faster than the conventional SATA (HDD) by nearly 10 times and NVMe SSD claims to be faster than SATA SSD by nearly 4 times. However, trust me, in today’s world, YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED A SSD DRIVE. I can’t even think of working on a HDD drive. Trust me people, there is a massive difference. When I upgraded to SSD on my old laptop, it was like upgrading to 5th gear from 1st gear. NVMe SSD is faster, agreed, but even SATA SSD is not bad, although I feel, there is not much of a price difference, MI should have put in NVMe, but I’m not complaining. (The horizon versions of MI laptops have NVMe SSDs).  BUT SSD (instead of HDD) IS NEEDED. PERIOD.- NOT A HARDCORE GAMING Laptop – So don’t expect this to be a super clocked gaming laptop. Nowhere does MI mention that. It’s pretty ok for games on the default settings and this one has Nvidia MX250. Should be ok for average and part time gamers. Haven’t really tried heavy games though. Remember, gaming laptops are different in the way they are configured specially with the GPU, cooling, ventilation and processor speed.- Multimedia is decent. This has DTS sound which makes some difference to the sound output compared to conventional sound. You can configure it your way with the pre-installed DTS Audio Processing app. I really think it’s almost similar to DOLBY ATMOS. DTS uses a higher bit rate though.- 8 GB RAM is quite adequate for almost everything unless you are a hardcore gamer.- One thing that people don’t mention is the surface grip. It has 2 horizontal rubber strips at the base which really hold the laptop well in its place, even when you tilt the table a bit. Doesn’t slide easily even if the surface is slippery which is quite good.- Did not experience heating at all. With all possible office softwares loaded which are still heavy on CPU and RAM, there was not much heating even while charging. Movies, music did not cause heating. Even running a game like ASPHALT did not heat it that much, though only ran it for some time. Prolonged gaming will surely cause heating as is the case with all machines. But this has plenty of heat ventilation slots at the bottom.- Thankfully, there’s only 1 sticker on the laptop and that’s a small i5 sticker and it’s neat and silver in colour. I just hated it when laptops put so many stickers like processor, GPU, sound etc. on the wrist panel.- The keyboard keys are well spaced just like a 15.6” laptop. So, if you’re used to typing on a 15.6” laptop like me, you wouldn’t notice any difference. I have seen horrible key spacing in some 14” laptops, but this one is pretty good.- Touchpad feels good. Supports multi-finger touch.- Another plus is the hinge mechanism. I found it pretty sturdy and tough and does not vibrate at all when you pull up the hood and release it. Let’s see how it gets with age.CONS – Yes it has CONS as well- I just dont like the new setups where the power button is on the top right of the keypad. I am used to the DELETE button being there. So pressed the power button accidentally many times.- The RAM and GPU cannot be upgraded. The RAM is fixed at 8 GB and so is the GPU. You cannot upgrade these. In fact, I believe these are factory attached to the motherboard and are non-detachable.- Webcam comes separately. Quality of the webcam is average, but can you imagine in this day and age, a separate webcam and not an inbuilt one. The worst part is it occupies one USB slot and is corded. If you don’t use a webcam, good for you.- The speakers are at the bottom. This is absolutely ludicrous. There’s so much of space on the top. The volume on full 100% is just so average like the laptops that were available 10+ years ago. Only the person sitting in front of the laptop can hear from the laptop speakers even in full volume. This is a disappointment, although I use earphones most of the times. Had the speakers been on top or sides, volume output would have been better.- The UP-DOWN keys are very important for all activities and they are really cramped on this keypad. MI should have configured these as full buttons, but most 14” have it similar.Other things worth mentioning- No Ethernet port, only 3 USD pots, 1 audio jack and 1 HDMI port- NO TYPE C / Thunderbolt port. NO SD Card reader port either TYPE C is there on the I7 version, but not there here.- No DVD drive or any optical drive.- The SSD somehow seems slower than expected when copying or writing. Could be a temporary thing.- The 30 day MS Office 365 trial is such a nothing. Microsoft themselves offer a 30 day trial for 365. Just that it’s installed on the machine.- USB 3.0 HDD with USB 3.0 cable with USB 3.0 port - file transfer to laptop seemed slower than expected. Again, could be a temporary thing.- The charging light is on the other side of the power cable slot.- NO backlight. Keypad has only 2 LEDs – one for the power button and one for CAPS LOCK.- Even with nothing open and all the extras shut, 4 GB RAM is consumed. :S- There are a couple of MI apps for instant wake up and fast data transfer with android phone. Haven’t tried those.CONCLUSION- If you want pure looks and a decent hardware, go for it. Looks are top class. Runs equally well. Plastic to metal is a big-big feel good factor and it’s really thin.- If you are hardcore gamer, DO NOT BOTHER about this one. It’s not for you.- Even average and part time gamers can consider this.- If you are anything other than a hardcode gamer, there is no reason to look for a competitor at this price. It is the cheapest in its segment. The base processor speed at 1.6 Ghz, Nvidia MX250, 512 GB SSD, 8 GB RAM are quite a configuration.- The battery life is awesome for WORK and multimedia.- Also, the RAM is not upgradeable, but honestly, have you really ever worked on something more than 8 GB? My office laptop is 16GB, but I just don’t find any difference in performance with respect to RAM.- MI Customer service has really improved over the years. However, answering you queries on phone is a different thing than getting your machine repaired. I’ve heard it takes time at the service centre. And anything classified by them as “damage”, has to be paid by you.PS: I have only used i5 laptops and higherGood luck with your purchase..

  The mi notebook 14 is the best one i got for that prize of 44 k , which have an i5 processor and 8 g ram with 2 gb graphics card and an 256gb sata ssd . The build quality was excellent and gave us a premium feel . The lap top looks exactly like an apple macbook . The best thing about this laptop is its display, which is best at this range .Its only take 5 seconds for boot up which is very fast . The keyboard travel was nice . Sound was not that much good but okay for that prize range . The very cons of this laptop is its web cam which is not good . The laptop was light weight and easy to carry . I have been using this laptop only for 2 days and its only a basic review from that two days usage .

  Hi there! Thanks for reading my review! Hope this helps, if you're gonna look for a laptop at a 40k budget. And this is a review, which is written after 2 months of usage. I ordered this lap on August 6, 2020, and got delivered by August 14, 2020.  The weird thing about the online purchase is the wait for the thing to get delivered. Ok, let me begin with the cons and then will jump into the pros.Most people here in the Amazon review section, complaining about there is no backlit for keyboard, no inbuilt webcam, no Type-C for charging/data transfer and no SD card reader. These cons won't bother you. So, I'm not considering these as cons in Mi Notebook 14. Apart from this, I noticed some brightness changes in display, when I'm at work. I thought this is might be part of an adaptive brightness setting. But I don't find any option to turn off in Display settings.And another difficulty, I found in this machine (I'm referring machine as Mi Notebook 14) is, when you charge this laptop without shutting it down (running background tasks) it heats up very quickly. I know we're charging this machine with a 65 W charging adapter. Maybe the heating issue while charging (without shutting it down) is because of this fast charging technology. But I don't like my lap is getting heated.At last, there is one more con, that I felt is, the hinge is not strong enough. When you're working under a ceiling fan or a high-speed fan the display vibrates back and forth. The change is clearly noticeable.Now we're jumping into pros.Highlights,* 10TH GEN CORE i5 chipset,* Punchy Display,* Packed with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD,* 65 W Fast Charging Technology,* 4 cell battery.Starting with Performance, you won't find any lag on this machine because of the latest processor from Intel and also packed with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD. The booting time is somewhere around 3 to 5 seconds. So, performance is top-notch.And talking about the display, the colours are vibrant and punchy. There are no issues on display, except the one which I was mentioned in the cons.Talking about the battery, the charging time is very less compared to other laptops in the market. I will mention battery stats in my usage. That is, it takes somewhere around 25 to 30 minutes to charge from 50 to 100%. This is not bad, right! And talking about battery life in my usage, my usage starts with a full charge. After two video calls ( each, one and a half an hour, that is totally 3 hours), 45% of battery still remained, which is also good. So you can expect an average of 5 to 6 hours of battery life.Finally, you're at the end of my review. So, think about the pros and cons which was mentioned above and go up with your decision. Hope this helps! Thank you!P.S. If you're considering this lap for coding, I will strongly recommend this lap to you, as I am doing coding tasks in this machine and I won't find any difficulty.

  So I have been using it for above a month. I needed a quick replacement and the specs for this seemed apt.Battery life: For office works, it last for about 5 hours. But I did not work continuously, so that's there. It's decent, nothing great.Performance: Super smooth and the 256 GB SSD makes things quite smooth. My job involves watching HD videos, and I was able to run multiple tabs on Google Chrome quite smoothly.Gaming: This is not a gaming laptop, but I did play quite a bit of Dark Souls 1 and a bit of GTA V. It was far from bad, and the performance was manageable considering you sacrifice on the graphics quality in settings.Thickness & design: Now to my favourite part about the laptop - the thickness and how it looks! I was in a dilemma between this and a good enough gaming laptop under 60k, but since I own two gaming consoles, I wanted a slick laptop, and this was the perfect choice! It's compact, looks gorgeous considering how slim it is and has no brand name on the front. So we could always fix us up some stickers like in a MacBook. It looks beautiful and classy! But the keyboard has no back-light.Overall, so far, so good. I do not plan to game on it, hence, hopefully it will last for a long time. It's a great buy for this price. Definitely recommend it over the Horizon Edition, as that does not justify its price like this (Standard Edition) does.

  Good specs at best price in the market. Using it for only 2 months, hence can't comment on reliability or after sales support from the company. Overall finish looks good, thickness & weight are OK. Battery life very good, getting about 5 hrs till now.But couldn't understand / didn't like why the camera is separate item, to be connected via a USB cable? Similar bezel size laptops from Lenovo have in-built camera, making it more compact. But here these are separate and cumbersome to use.

  First of all as the headline says, stop thinking it is a low quality Chinese product, it really is not.Build quality:-really really light (not just saying that, it really is very light and prtable love that about this device).-it well built and is very sturdy.-display is 1080p IPS panel with good viewing angles and decently bright brightness levels.-Keyboard is also decent enough and have good travel. (does not have backlight keyboard.-Audio is also okay-ish nothing great but not a deal breaker also.Peformance:**this is not a gaming machine**-i did play celeste and farcry 2 on this device, celeste worked perfectly fine (low spec game) but farcry 2 was not really a very smooth experience yet the device on the integrated card ran the game at medium settings at 30fps so i would say maybe some older titles such as max payne 2 or vice city or indie titles could run smoothly but not new titles.-playing games like Farcry2 did overheat the system quite a bit, but usually 8-10tabs of chrome and sharekhan applications plus some music never stresses the machine.-BAttery life is also a plus point of this product, my screen on time with loud music+BLUETOOTH+ full brightness  was around 4-5 hours... which is great tbh.Verdict: See this is a really nice system with i5 processor that will let you do all of the productivity tasks such as word, excel, publisher, some light photo editing, netflix, youtube, etc. if you want anything more than that such as bitcoin mining or video editing or gaming, i would not suggest you this.Anybody looking to buy something for their parents or kids to study/work and maybe a little multimedia and ight games this is a really solid device. I bought this laptop for my mother as a gift to her and she really loves it. (portability and battery are the main points here)

  I'll admit, I'm not the average user of laptops. My demands from it are low. I need it to boot quickly, run without significant lag and last for a long time without need for significant repair.I bought it 6 months ago, and at the time, all other laptop options under 50,000 simply sucked. There was nothing available with a processor that was not embarrassingly old or one that some brand wasn't trying to discount and liquidate stock. I would personally have preferred a Dell or Acer but most of them in this range were either i3 or old AMD or were renewed or were HDD.Mi met all these criteria. Using the webcam requires the use of a USB, but that's not a huge issue. Video quality is good.Screen quality is excellent. The laptop only comes with a trial version of Office, so you need to buy that separately or use another application.Sound quality is strictly OK. The speakers are located under the laptop so you need a hard surface if you want good output. I'd recommend a bluetooth device if you want better quality audio.It would have been good to have backlit keys, but I'd be happy if they don't come loose, at this price.The power button is also a key, so I'm concerned about how long it will hold up.The function keys functionality is reversed. So if you want to open help, it is Fn F1. Simply pressing f1 will mute your laptop.Overall, I am happy with the purchase. Let's hope it lasts.

  I would request buyers to kindly check the product before you buy. its a Laptop but you cant keep it on your lap bcoz your thighs will burn. the keypad becomes hot and even if you connect with Dell team they will say that its normal for the laptop to heat up. I bought this product from Croma Store Saket and i feel i wasted my money. please buy any other laptop but not Dell.
